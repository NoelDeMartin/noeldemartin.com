After giving it some thought I've finished the revamp of the [Autonomous Data website](https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data/). I ended up calling it an "architecture" and at some points an "ideology". I don't think it's right to only call it architecture because there are also some other implications that go beyond tech.

The site will probably stay as it is for a while. I'll focus my efforts on actually building Autonomous Data applications, and I may add a directory of apps there and in my site.

What would be great though is if I get some feedback!
