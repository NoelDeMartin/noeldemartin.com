Hey!

I just uploaded the recording of my second talk, so I can officially say that I'm done with this task. If you want to watch the recordings, you can find them in my Youtube channel:

- [Thoughts on Solid Developer Experience](https://youtu.be/ghGmveKKe5Y)
- [Solid CRDTs in Practice](https://youtu.be/vYQmGeaQt8E)

See you at the Symposium next year! (maybe)
