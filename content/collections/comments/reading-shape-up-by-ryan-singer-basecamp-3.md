I've finished reading Part 1 (Chapters 2-6), focused on shaping. I understood shaping as the preliminary work done before getting started with a task. I would recommend anyone who wants to learn more about the book to go read the chapter and sub-chapter titles, because they are quite self-explanatory and you can learn a lot from that already.

I think their suggestions for shaping up work are great. They really spend a good ammount of time thinking about a problem, contemplating different possibilities, and avoid getting lost in minute details. In particular, I enjoyed learning about [breadboarding](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding), given that I always do wireframes. Sure, low fidelity wireframes, but I'm still conditioning the UI from the get go.

As I said in my previous comment, I will also try to poke some holes in their arguments though. And something I don't completely buy into is how to choose what ideas to shape up. They mention that the book isn't about how to choose what to build, but I am missing some interaction with users on the whole process. Maybe they can be excused because they are heavy users of their own product (Basecamp), so they already have that point of view built-in. But I don't think that's the best strategy for everyone.

They also mention not using a backlog and I'm also not completely convinced. Of course I agree that backlogs can be a dread, and they can grow out of proportion. That's why I think backlog grooming is important and you can be as extreme as you want with that. But I don't think I'd be confortable with not having a backlog at all. The next part seems to go further into why they don't do backlogs, so we'll see what else I can learn.
