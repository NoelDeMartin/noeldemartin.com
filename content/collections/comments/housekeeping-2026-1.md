I've decided to follow [DHH's playbook](https://world.hey.com/dhh/it-s-a-beelink-baby-243fdaf1), so I bought a Beelink SER5. I have been working on an Asus TUF laptop for ~5 years, and before that I also worked mostly on a laptop. It's been almost 8 years since I've had a desktop PC 😱. But it isn't as bad as it sounds, because I do have a screen and a mouse/keyboard, so most of the time I'm using the laptop as a desktop PC 😅. Still, it is very annoying to constantly plug it in and out, and moving the laptop around. So I'm excited for this :). Regarding specs, it "only" has 24GB RAM and it's not the best of the bunch. But honestly, it's been years since I've cared about these things. I'm currently running on 16GB RAM, and honeslty I don't have any performance issues. It's funny, because I love computers and software; but I couldn't care less about RAMs, CPUS, or any of the specs. I guess I'm mostly a software guy :).

I'm also going to give Omarchy a try. I have been using Ubuntu for ~15 years, and I haven't touched windows since. I also have never owned an Apple device, so changin my OS could be very impactful. But the truth is that I don't have anything fancy, and the reason I haven't tried any other distributions yet is because Ubuntu has been "good enough". However, I've always been curious, and I've been tempted more than once to try Debian or Arch. What really excites me about Omarchy, besides the fact that I like DHH's taste, is that it seems to be super configurable. So I'm looking forward to not switching again for the next 15 years. We'll see how it pans out!

Other than that, I'll also use this task to go over some of my self-hosting setup. I've already talked about this in many of my other tasks, but TLDR here's everything I am self-hosting at the moment:

- [Mastodon](https://github.com/noeldemartin/mastodon)
- [Nextcloud](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/nextcloud)
- [noeldemartin.com](https://noeldemartin.com) (this site!)
- [proxy.noeldemartin.com](https://proxy.noeldemartin.com)
- [vocab.noeldemartin.com](https://vocab.noeldemartin.com)
- [LSS](https://github.com/noelDeMartin/lss) (a Laravel Solid Server that uses Nextcloud for Storage)
- [Rem](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/rem) (I'm probably going to remove this)
- [Jazz Store](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/jazz-store) (I'm also going to remove this)

And the tools I'm using to orchestrate and manage all of this are [kanjuro](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/kanjuro) (docker), [rireki](https://github.com/noelDeMartin/rireki) (backups), and [nginx-agora](https://github.com/noelDeMartin/nginx-agora).
