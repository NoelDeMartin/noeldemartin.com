I wasn't completely sure if I'd be attending this year's Symposium, given my recent [frustrations with NLNet](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/the-soul-crushing-reality-of-job-seeking#the-nlnet-fiasco) and the subsequent decision to forego the idea of working with Solid full-time.

However! The guys at [Muze](https://www.muze.nl/), who are organizing this year's conference, reached out and have been very supportive. Thanks to their encouragement and support, I'll be there!

What's more, I'm also giving a talk that I'm calling "Solid Unleashed" (as a wink to [Wētā Workshop Unleashed](https://www.wetaworkshop.com/tours/auckland) :D). It works out perfectly, because it will be a nice way to close this period of working with Solid full-time before going back to side-projects. In the presentation, I'll share some tips to make Solid Apps, and talk about what I hope will be the future of Solid App development. Or at least, my future with Solid as a side-project.
