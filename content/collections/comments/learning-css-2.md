I just finished two more modules of the course: Rendering Logic I & II.

When I started this task I was somewhat worried that I'd be giving away too much of the course by journaling what I learn. But now, I'm totally convinced that's not the case at all. The content goes extremely in depth. Even when he talks about things I've been using for years, I feel like I'm back in university being told about a new concept alien to me (which is awesome!).

So yeah, I still totally recommend the course :D. I will refrain from bringing up this point in every update though, or it'll get tedious. But I've been blown away by [Josh](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)'s teaching, and I'm sure I'll be following him for years on end.

Now, about what I've actually learned in these two modules. They tackle some of the most basic properties you can think of: `width`, `display`, `position`, etc. But instead of just explaining what the properties do, the modules introduce the mental models to understand why they work the way they do. Which also includes learning about new properties and tricks, but that's the least important.

In particular, these concepts were new to me:

- [Margin Collapse](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/rules-of-margin-collapse/) — He's got a free blog post on that!
- [Stacking Contexts](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/) — Also a free blog post, this is the one I mentioned in my previous update.
- [Logical Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties)
- [Scroll Containers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container)

Other than learning about the concepts, exercises are also quite fun. Even though you think by reading the lessons that you already understand everything, the exercises did get me to notice something I'd missed in a couple of occasions.

And finally, [workshops](https://github.com/topics/css-for-js?q=user%3ANoelDeMartin) have also been great. What I noticed in these is how hard it is to get rid of bad habits :/. I'm so used to writing CSS with trial and error when something doesn't work, that it's difficult to actually think about the underlying mental models of the language. But after some dedication, I did manage to apply the learnings from the course.
