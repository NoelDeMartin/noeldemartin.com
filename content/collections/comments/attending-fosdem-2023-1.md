I've been to FOSDEM twice, in [2019](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem) and [2020](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem-2020). It's probably my favourite conference, so I'm really looking forward to being there again! (not that I attend that many, though). This year it's also extra special, because I'm also presenting for the first time:

<figure>

  <figcaption class="text-sm">(Yes, I spent way more time making this slide than I care to admit üòÖÔ∏è)</figcaption>
</figure>

I've also had a couple of people from the Solid community telling me they'll be there, so in a way this will be my first in-person Solid meetup as well :).

The presentation is coming up nicely, although I worry it's too dense :/. It wasn't easy to condense what I've done in 4 years to 30 minutes. I've re-read all my journals and that's been fun. You could say the presentation is just a summary of those. Still, I'm sure it will be valuable even for those who've read them (it won't have any of the rambling! \[like this one xD\]).

I also gave [sli.dev](https://sli.dev) a try, which was promising. But after a couple of hours fighting with CSS I decided to go back to my trusty LibreOffice. I like the idea to make my presentations in code, and it certainly has a couple of features I envy. But in the end, I was too slow making things work that took me 2 minutes in LibreOffice (maybe [I'm not good enough at CSS yet](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/learning-css)).

In any case, that's going well!

Like always, I won't be able to attend all the talks I'd like to. But here's the ones that got my attention:

- Afternoon / Evening @ Delirium Caf√©. Unfortunately, the [Beer event](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/beerevent/) has been cancelled this year :(. But I'm pretty sure many attendees will be there anyways, so I'll be sure to pay a visit.
