Now that we're well into autumn (although it doesn't feel like that over here!), I'm going to close this task as finished.

The plants have been on decay for a while, and I even stopped watering them a couple of weeks ago. So today I removed the plants and cleaned up the garden for next year. Needless to say, though, this task has been a huge success, and this is the expected end to the yearly cycle. I did ponder whether to plant some other seasonal plants for autumn or winter, but ultimately I decided I wouldn't. I'll probably get back to it next year, but I'm not sure if I'll continue talking about it here. I guess it'll depend if I have something interesting to share or if it's just more of the same.

For a first time experience, it went a lot better than I expected, and even though the fruits weren't huge, it was well worth it. I definitely got a year's worth of jalapeños, which was my number one goal in terms of output. Some of them I already cooked as jalapeño poppers, others I pickled (which I often add to salads), and the rest are stored in the freezer.

But that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement, of course. For starters, I did plant the vegetables too close to each other, and that's probably one of the reasons why some fruits were small. It was also a pain having to water daily, and ask for help when I left for holidays. Something I may explore next year is an automated watering system, or maybe give self-watering containers a try. And finally, I'd like to try planting other varieties. The only herb I planted was basil, and I'd like to give cilantro a try as well. Tomatoes were nice, but I'm not sure if I'll plant them again because the ones I could buy at the store were a lot better. And the lettuce was a complete failure, so it would be nice to grow that one properly.

And that's it! Here's some pictures to close this down properly:
