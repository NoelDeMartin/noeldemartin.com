The third chapter introduces the best way to get started with Digital Minimalism: a Marie Kondo-esque Digital Declutter. Of course, he doesn't mention Marie Kondo, but that's exactly what it is. I agree with the idea that this kind of change needs to be done at once (although ironically I am doing my "progressive self-enhancement" slowly).

The concrete suggested approach is to take 30 days off of all non essential technology, use that period to learn what's more important to our life and then reintroduce the technology in a way that can help what we value the most.

One last thing I got from this chapter is a reason he mentions as to why people seem reticent to stop using some technologies. He says it may feel uncomfortable to drop some because we've become accustomed to the distractions, and they should be reevaluated with a clean slate that you get after 30 days of not using them. I fully agree with that, many times we have some opinions about something but it isn't until we see it from another perspective that we can truly assess our opinions.

The explanation and procedure is cool, although I'm not sure if I'll do it because I don't really feel that I have any technology that I need to drop. Something I didn't like about the chapter was the examples though. Too many of them and they seem to be there just to fill space. They would have done as annex to skim over.
