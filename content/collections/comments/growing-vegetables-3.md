Now that we're right in the middle of Summer, I thought it's about time that I gave an update on how this is going. And the short version is: Success!

I've accomplished my initial goal of eating something grown from seed, and to be honest this has surpassed my expectations by a long shot, which is nice :). For details, continue reading. And if you only want to see some pics, scroll to the end.

Last time, I mentioned that some flowers were sprouting. By the end of June, I could already see some of the first tomatoes showing themselves. And by the end of July, I harvested the first ones. After eating them, I cannot say that they are the best tomatoes I ever tried. To be honest, I didn't see that much difference in flavor from tomatoes that haven't been freshly harvested as I had read. But they are good and definitely a success :D. I'll probably grow them again next year (and they're still giving fruit). I didn't use them a lot for salads, the ones I buy at the store taste better, but they are perfect for [Pisto](https://umai.noeldemartin.com/viewer?url=https://noeldemartin.solidcommunity.net/cookbook/pisto#it).

One the other hand, jalapeños have been late bloomers. They didn't show flowers until late June, and even though fruits started showing up early July, I haven't harvested them yet. One issue I'm having overall is that I don't know when to harvest the plants. For tomatoes, it seems like shortly after they turn red is a good time. But jalapeños should be harvested right before turning red, or even when they are red. And that hasn't happened yet. Still, some of them already show some lines and I'm pretty sure I could pick them up if I wanted.

The rest of the plants are doing so-and-so. Basil did well, but I harvested it too late and it's not in good shape anymore. And the lettuce is still growing but I have no idea when to pick it up, because it's quite small (I think the container I'm using isn't big enough).

By the way, last time I mentioned I'd have some issues during holidays. What I ended up doing is asking for help and someone came over to water the plants. But instead of doing it every day, I settled for doing it every two days and covered the plants so that they don't suffer as much from the sun. I'd say it worked out because they are still alive and I haven't seen any detriment to their growth.

Something else to mention is that for a while some of the tomato plants started showing yellow spots in their leafs. Reading online this doesn't seem too uncommon, and just removing the entire [tomato suckers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tomato+suckers) was enough to stop them spreading too much.

And that's about it, I'll probably do one or two more updates before closing the task for this season. But I'm already super happy with the results :).

I didn't grow the cherries from seed though, that's why I didn't mention them before.
