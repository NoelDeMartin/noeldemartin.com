After dragging it a lot, I've finally completed the book. The last 2 chapters were excruciating to read, I even skipped some parts.

For one, I've validated that I don't like reading non-digital books. At least with the reading habits that I have now (I read mostly on my commute). And I also miss the ability to take highlights, so I ended up writing them by hand to Evernote (again, not ideal in my commute). I've tried with a Kindle book before, but as [I've already explained](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport) I don't like having to rely on Amazon or private technology. And I recently started [reading a book in the web](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-shape-up-by-ryan-singer-basecamp), which I like a lot conceptually, but let's see how it goes in practice. All in all, PDFs are still my preferred format for reading. But unfortunately, they are not easy to get legally.

The other thing that made it so difficult to read was the topic. The last two chapters are focused on why Spain was lacking on scientific advancements back then (1900s). I have to confess that, in general, I don't like history. Specially not this kind. It reminded me a lot of the texts I was forced to read back in highschool. Luckily enough, I'm not forced to do it anymore, so I skipped some. But I do like other kind of history. For example, I'm a huge fan of Dan Carlin's [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series) podcast.

So yeah, even though it's finished with this somber note, it's done! I have to say overall I enjoyed it a lot, and I'd recommend anyone to check it out. I'll probably come back to my notes in the future.
