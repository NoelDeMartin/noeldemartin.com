Today I completed Lesson 10, in which I made a summary of what I learned through the workshop. My top takeaways were the following:

- **Smallest Viable Audience:** Focus on the smallest viable audience, not the biggest. This will allow you to create real connections and not fall into the trap of pleasing everyone. This concept also ties neatly with the much-quoted concept of [1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) by kevin kelly.

- **Tension:** Quoting text from the workshop: "Tension is what we feel when something might not work and what we feel when we might be left behind or left out". I found this concept important to understand if a product or service is "good". I'd always thought about value proposition, but keeping this in mind also accounts for the context where a product will be served.

- **Assets & Compounding:** I always thought compounding is very important and it's actually one of the keys to success. In the workshop the concept of assets is emphasized as "owning something makes the work you are doing easier over time". I found it useful to see them as the materialization of the compounding effect.

If you want to dig deeper into these concepts and everything I learned, Seth released a new book last month called [This is Marketing](https://seths.blog/tim). And for what I've heard in interviews and reading the abstract, it seems to cover the same topics. So I'll definitely read it myself at some point.

If you prefer to read bite-sized content, [Seth's blog](https://seths.blog) has got many posts talking about all of this, so head to the search page and start typing away.

The workshop will stay active until January 1st 2019, so I'll close this task then.
