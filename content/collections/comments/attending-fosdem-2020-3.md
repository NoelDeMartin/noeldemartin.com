My second day at FOSDEM was more talk heavy than the first. I started attending the first talk I had planned and I ended up assisting to all of them plus another 4.

One of the talks, [Building Ethical Software Under Capitalism](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/capitalismethicaloss/), was done by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/). This was one of the talks I enjoyed the most, and last year I also liked one of their talks, so I'll keep that in mind for the future.

Interistingly enough, the Javascript talks were the ones I enjoyed the least. I think the main reason is that I didn't learn anything new. People are still taking about PWAs like they are something new and assuming nobody in the audience knows what they are. But I think at this point they are old news and I just hope that people start using them. With the tools there are out there ([Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/pwa), [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/), etc.) it should be really easy for anyone to get started.

I also attended one talk about the current state of mobile operative systems and the existing alternatives to Android and iOS. My impression is that it's in a sorry state of affairs, because all of them looked like developer focused and it doesn't seem like any of them will become user friendly anytime soon. I guess I'll just install [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) in my 5-year old phone and hope for the best.

Finally, I only attended one talk in the privacy and decentralization devroom, and that was about decentralizing the fediverse. There had been a talk earlier about [The Dat Protocol](https://dat.foundation/) and I regret missing it, so I'll probably watch the recorded session.

Talking with some people from work, I also found out about a Japanese company called [Wafflecell](http://blade.wafflecell.com/hp/). It seems really cool because they provide internet modems that come with Nextcloud installed. Of course, this is only available for Japan but it is awesome and I hope that more companies start providing this kind of solution. In the end, decentralization will only go mainstream if this kind of things start popping up.

So that's a wrap!
