Last day of Fosdem, the highlight of the day has been without a doubt Ruben Verborgh's presentation of Solid. If you don't know anything about Solid, or even if you do, I recommend that you watch the recording that will be uploaded here: https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/solid_web_decentralization/

After the presentation I joined a small group of people to continue the conversation with him outside. The future that they are trying to create is very interesting, and even if Solid doesn't find widespread adoption, I'm still excited to see the communities that'll be created.

I also had the chance to speak with members of the SAFE Network project, who are very interested in using Solid on their network. After chatting for a while I understood the gist of what they do, and I believe it's a great initiative. The only thing I'm not convinced about is that it's an immutable data network, which means that data cannot be deleted, only modified (maintaining a modifications history).
