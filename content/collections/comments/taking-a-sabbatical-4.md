Hi again!

I'm now writing from Saigon, Vietnam. I have managed to slow down a bit since my last update, but overall I feel mostly the same way. TLDR: I'm enjoying it, but also I can't wait to get back home.

### Life Stuff

I won't spend too much time talking about it again, but yeah I still lack time affluence and I'm tired of the nomadic lifestyle. The good news is that we're past the half-way point now, and it's not like I'm being tortured or anything ðŸ˜…. I'll do my best to enjoy the time we have left, and try to squeeze some time to tinker here and there.

In my last update we were in Thailand, and we had just said goodbye to Moo Deng. Since then, we've visited more of Thailand, went through Cambodia, and we've just arrived to Vietnam.

Thailand was awesome, probably my favourite country so far. After Bangkok, we went to Chiang Mai and I really enjoyed this part of the trip. We continued visiting a lot of temples, and Chiang Mai in particular had tons of them. I really like Asian temples, they are so colorful and quirky. They always remind me of Gantz's [Buddhist Temple Alien Mission](https://gantz.fandom.com/wiki/Buddhist_Temple_Alien_Mission), and I think some statue will try to kill me ðŸ¤£. But I'm starting to feel a bit of "temple overload", they are starting to look the same to me :/. I guess that's normal when you experience too much of something (although I never seem to get tired of Japan or cats).

I also managed to do some co-working :D. I had been to a couple of meetups before, but similar to [my experience in Japan](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/working-from-japan#comment-3), they weren't great. But then, I realized there is another website I can use to find cool people: [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com)! Through that, I learned about [Hackamai](https://hackamai.com/), and [I had a great time](https://x.com/naz_avo/status/1844236913483579659/). You can read more about it in the "Tech Stuff" section. Unfortunately, I could only join a single day because, again, we left Chiang Mai too soon :(. Oh well, that's life.

After Thailand, we went to Cambodia. I noticed some stark differences right away. For example, there were a lot of "Tuk Tuks" that consisted of a carriage strapped to a motorbike. I am amazed at the resourcefulness of people in some contexts, I would never have thought that a meager motorbike was able to carry so much load (see pics below).

Something else that surprised me was how money works. They use both their own currency, Riels, and American dollars. But Riels are so worthless, that they serve as small change (1000 Riels are worth 0.25 cents :/). They don't even use coins, and it's not uncommon to pay or receive change in mixed currencies. Which is interesting, because you can see the price in both currencies everywhere (even in electronic displays and receipts, I can't imagine what types of headaches this has caused engineers ðŸ˜…).

Other than that, temples also had a different vibe. We visited "the largest religious structure in the world", [Angkor Wat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat). These reminded me a lot of Indiana Jones, and we even visited a temple were the first Tom Raider movie was filmed: [Ta Prohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Prohm). Is it weird that everything reminds me of movies and manga?

On that note, visiting the cinema was also a new experience. Every country seems to have some peculiarities. What striked me the most in Thailand and Cambodia was that they play the national anthem with a short "ad" about the royalty :/. In Cambodia, people even stand up during the anthem. Sadly, what doesn't seem to change in any country is that they play tons of ads before the movie. I still can't believe they managed to insert ads in a paid experience like this, and people doesn't riot... thank god for [Phenomena Experience](https://www.phenomena-experience.com/) in Barcelona. By the way, I really enjoyed watching [The Substance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17526714). I particularly enjoyed it because I hadn't seen any trailers, and the way the plot unfolds was a pleasant surprise. I can't say the same about [The Wild Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29623480/), which I also enjoyed but the trailer gave away pretty much the entire movie. If only you could go to the cinema just to watch a movie!

Anyhow, after that we moved to Vietnam. So far I'm enjoying it as well, it's funny how just after crossing the border we started seeing those traditional Vietnamese hats. We've barely been here for a couple of days, so I'll leave my impressions on Vietnam for the next update.

Here's some more pics:

This is what most Tuk Tuks are like in Cambodia. As you can see, they're not only used to transport people. And this isn't even the heaviest I've seen.

### Tech Stuff

Last time, I mentioned that I was working on some more examples for my animations library, Vivant. And well, this month... I've almost exclusively been doing that ðŸ˜…. Originally, I intended to use this time to work on small proofs of concept, but this one got a bit out of hand.

In my defense, I'll say that I used the opportunity to also do a proof of concept for a new way to build packages. For most of my libraries, I'm still relying on Rollup and some scripts I wrote 3 years ago. But I've learned a lot since then, and the ecosystem has also changed. This time, I tried using Deno and [jsr.io](https://jsr.io/), because [their vision is really compelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swXWUfufu2w). Unfortunately, we're not there yet :/. I gave it five minutes, but I started seeing isoteric errors I didn't understand ("has no exported member default export"!?). Then, in less than five minutes, I set it up with Vite and it worked :D. Now I'm using Vite for everything: development, publishing libraries, building apps, running tests, etc. I can't wait to migrate everything to this new setup!

The thing that took most of my time, though, was implementing the animations themselves (and also spending some time trying to make the playground pretty ðŸ˜…). But I'm super happy with the results. Even if it's just a proof of concept, the animations are pretty cool, and I'm very happy with the way the project is structured and the code itself. I can also sleep well at night knowing that this proof of concept is "Done". I'll continue making animations for sure, but I believe this is a solid base I can build upon. If you're curious to see the animations, or the repository, check it out here: [Vivant Playground](https://noeldemartin.github.io/vivant/)

There are also a couple more things I'd like to talk about. First of all, it was great to find [Hackamai](https://hackamai.com/). I really like all the people I met there, and hopefully I'll be able to attend more events from [the Hacka\* network](https://hacka.network/). But I'm also feeling some dissonance with this community. There is some obsession with growth hacking, and no small amount of the conversations revolve around search rankings, [backlinking](https://www.submitjuice.com/), "[printing money](https://x.com/marc_louvion/status/1848344738409193644)", and many other things I despise. But the truth is that it would probably do me some good to learn more of that ðŸ˜…. I mentioned before how I don't do any analytics on my sites, and frankly, I don't spend much time doing [marketing](https://seths.blog/tim/) and spreading the word. My only virtue in that department is that [I work in the open](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/open-productivity), and thanks to that some people hear about me. But if I ever want to make a living as an indie developer, I'll have to improve my game.

Finally, I was surprised by Dan Abramov's [Web Without Walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1sJW6nTP6E). The talk is awesome, and he explains some of the reasons why I care about Solid and other decentralized projects. He talks about Bluesky and the AT protocol, but for 90% of the things he's saying, he could as well be talking about Solid. I especially like that this is happening "in the mainstream", in a React conference, and by one of the most beloved React developers. However, there are also some things I don't like so much. I expanded upon this in a social media thread, and got some responses (including from Dan himself!). If you're keen to learn more, check these out:
