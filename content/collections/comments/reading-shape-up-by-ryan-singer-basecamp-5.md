And that's it for Part 3! This part was big, and it focuses on building.

For starters, I really share their view on autonomy for developers and designers. As explained on [chapter 7](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.1-chapter-09), they assign projects, not tasks. I've referred to this in the past as "missions", and I think it's super important in order to keep everyone motivated. It doesn't matter how interesting tasks are, if all you're doing is checking off tasks on a list you didn't define, you'll eventually lose motivation. I also think it's very important that everyone gets first-hand experience making trade-offs and owning up to them.

Another concept that's introduced here are [scopes](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.3-chapter-11#the-scope-map), and I found them very insightful. Truth be told, most of the time what I call "tasks" are actually scopes, and I often create sub-tasks to track more granular todos. Throughout the book I've found this with different concepts, things I already kind of did but didn't have a word for them or hadn't thought them through completely. So I found reading this book not only great to learn new concepts, but also good to better understand and improve some things I was already doing subconsciously.

The last thing that got my attention were hill charts and imagined vs discovered tasks. Again, something I already sort-of did. But I was not seeing it with so much clarity. I was aware than more tasks appear as a project makes progress, and I saw it as the cost of doing business. But the reality is that it's part of the process, so it makes sense not only to expect them but embrace them. I've always been aware that estimates are off most of the time, but my way to deal with them was to increase the estimated effort depending on uncertainty. So a task that I would value at 4 but there was uncertainty I'd put it at 6 or 8. But it's true that it doesn't make sense on a per-task basis, I was just making up a buffer for the whole project.

Overall, I liked the book a lot. And I'd recommend anyone to read it whole (it isn't even that long). If you don't want to read everything, I'd suggest at least reading the chapter titles and go into the ones that grab your attention. Also check out the [summary](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/4.2-appendix-03) appendix. For me in particular, these are the parts I enjoyed the most:

- [Chapter 1: Introduction](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01)
- [Subchapter 4.2: Breadboarding](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding)
- [Subchapter 6.1: Ingredient 1. Problem](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06#ingredient-1-problem)
- [Subchapter 6.2: Ingredient 2. Appetite](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06#ingredient-2-appetite)
- [Subchapter 6.3: Ingredient 3. Solution](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06#ingredient-3-solution)
- [Chapter 7: Bets, Not Backlogs](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.1-chapter-07)
- [Subchapter 8.5: The meaning of a bet](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#the-meaning-of-a-bet)
- [Subchapter 8.6: Uninterrupted time](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#uninterrupted-time)

- [Chapter 9: Hand Over Responsibly](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.1-chapter-09)
- [Subchapter 11.2: The scope map](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.3-chapter-11#the-scope-map)
- [Subchapter 12.3: Work is like a hill](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-12#work-is-like-a-hill)
- [Subchapter 12.4: Scopes on the hill](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-12#scopes-on-the-hill)

There were two other things I wanted to do on this task. One was experiment reading an html book, and I liked it. It was easy for the most part, the copy-pasting for highlights wasn't too painful, and being html I could have easily manipulated it if I wanted to. And the other was put my judgement glasses on and try to find things I disagreed with. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I couldn't find many. And the ones I found are intentional. In particular that not all these tips can be applied to any context and the importance of choosing what to build.

Now, before I close this task, I'll listen to [two](https://rework.fm/shape-up/) [episodes](https://rework.fm/shape-up-roundtable/) of the Rework podcast, where they talk about the book. After that, that's it for this task!
