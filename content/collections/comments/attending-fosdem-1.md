I've looked at the schedule and I decided to write down the talks that got my attention. I won't be able to attend all of them (some overlap and I'm not Dr. Manhattan). But it's good to have some fallbacks in case the rooms are full. I'll also be able to watch them afterwards because they should be recorded.

If you're going to any of those let me know! It'll be more fun if we can share our thoughts :).

I'll probably meet with some guys from the [SAFE Network](https://safenetwork.tech) forum. I didn't know about the project, but they are also interested in Decentralization. So I'm sure some interesting conversations will come up.

Here's the list of talks:
