Today, I'm writing from Shanghai, China.

If you read my previous update, you may be thinking that I came here from Vietnam. But actually, I just got back from New Zealand! I haven't made much progress on the tech stuff, but the trip is coming to an end soon, and it was nice to get some change of airs.

### Life Stuff

Something I didn't mention before is how much I've enjoyed traveling on land. Since we landed in Singapore, we've been moving around on bus, train, and taxi (or TukTuk). If you're curious about the itinerary, make sure to check today's pictures. Obviously, we flew to New Zealand. But first, let's backtrack to my previous update: Vietnam.

We spent about 2 weeks in Vietnam, and it was pretty cool. There were more motorbikes than in any other country I've been, but contrary to my expectations, it wasn't too difficult to move around. Sure, it's very chaotic and there are hundreds of bikes passing by as you cross the street. But they are used to it, and if you keep a constant pace and don't do anything weird, it's actually pretty safe. I definitely suffered the traffic a lot more in other countries, specially in Cambodia.

One of the highlights in Saigon was visiting [Cu Chi tunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_tunnels). They reminded me a lot of Hardcore History's [Supernova in the East](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-62-supernova-in-the-east-i/), even though those tunnels have nothing to do with the time period covered in the series.

Eventually, we moved towards Hanoi riding what is apparently [one of the world's most amazing train journeys](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/worlds-most-amazing-train-journeys) (Vietnam's Reunification Express). We didn't take the whole trip at once though (which is about 34 hours long). We stopped in Hoi An, Dong Hoi, and Ninh Binh; and saw lantern boats, caves, and yes, more temples! üòÖ

Then, it was time to leave South East Asia behind, and we flew to New Zealand. This may seem out of left field, but we had been considering it for a while. We figured that we won't be repeating a trip like this any time soon, and this was a unique opportunity to visit one of the world's most remote places (specially from Spain!). Plus, as you may know, [I'm a big Lord of The Rings fan](https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/viewer?c=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.noeldemartin.com%2Ffavorite-movies%2F).

Our first day in NZ, I got to meet [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) and [his cute pet rats](https://sive.rs/rats). It was awesome meeting him in person, and he gave us some great travel tips. The first of which I wasn't too keen on following: Renting a car üò±. Now, he wasn't the first person to mention it, but the problem here is that I hate driving (I HATE driving). So I was trying to find any excuse to avoid it. But I finally relented, and it was the right choice. I still don't like driving (and to be honest, my partner did most of it), but NZ really is a country that's best experienced with your own transportation.

What followed were 2 of the most frantic weeks in the trip üòÖ. If I had been complaining about lack of time affluence before, I barely spent 4 hours in side projects in NZ. Having our own vehicle, we weren't as limited as before; and exploring NZ lends itself to moving around a lot more. We rarely spent time in cities. I also didn't spend much time reading nor listening to podcasts, it really feels like I was 100% on holiday mode for these 2 weeks. Still, they were 2 of the weeks I've enjoyed the most in the whole trip :D.

We followed the [NZ Frenzy Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20170719161327/http://www.nzfrenzy.com/) as a baseline. It's a bit outdated, but overall it's pretty good and I'm sure our experience without it would have been a lot worse. Even though we only visited the North island, we weren't able to see everything we would've liked. There is so much cool stuff in New Zealand!

One of my favorite things when traveling is meeting the wildlife, and there is plenty in NZ. We met Cows, Sheep, Tuis, Pukekos, Black Swans, Glowworms, Sea Lions, etc. We even [saw kiwis up close](https://www.kiwihouse.org.nz/)! And the nature is stunning, as you may imagine. I particularly enjoyed many of the geothermal oddities, and doing the [Tongariro Alpine Crossing](https://www.tongarirocrossing.org.nz/) (which passes right by [Mount Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ngauruhoe)).

Talking about Mount Doom... Yeah, LOTR. For once, I'm justified in associating my travels with movies xD. We visited as many LOTR filming locations as we could, and the best one was definitely [Hobbiton](https://www.hobbitontours.com/). Apparently, the set was destroyed after filming the LOTR trilogy, but rebuilt permanently for The Hobbit trilogy and it's now one of the most popular spots in NZ (for tourists, I'm sure). We also visited the [WƒìtƒÅ Workshop](https://www.wetaworkshop.com/), who've won multiple oscars for their work in the movies. We got to see some behind the scenes of the movie-making process; even some original props like [the geisha robot from Ghost in the Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WByTgV-_354) and Sauron's armor ü§©.

Now, we're back to Asia. In what is probably the region's most interesting country, China. We're only spending two weeks here, but I already have some anecdotes to share. You'll have to wait for the next update though, stay tuned!

### Tech Stuff

This month, I haven't spent a lot of time on tech stuff, but I have a couple of things to mention.

First, I've been playing with [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). Yes, I'm also feeling AI fatigue (I was feeling it before the term was coined), so I've been quite slow at adopting AI tools. But this one picked my interest, which is funny because not many people in my circles is talking about it. If it weren't for [Foc a Terra](https://rss.com/podcasts/focaterra/1700236/), I may not even know that it exists. But I gave it a try, and it's looking very promising. I'm exploring it in two areas:

- Making my content more accessible.

    If you're reading this, you know that I ramble a lot on these notes (I'm amazed that anyone even reads them). But [it would be too much work to make them shorter](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter). The idea of converting them into a short podcast was enticing, so I tried to generate a podcast with [my notes on building Umai](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-recipes-manager-using-solid), and I have to say I'm quite happy with the outcome.

    Of course, it wasn't without hallucinations, and I went through 40+ iterations. To be fair though, the problem was more that they weren't saying what I wanted them to say, rather than conveying wrong information. I can see a world in which I create these podcasts, and add some commentary of my own to correct mistakes and mention anything that was left out. But there is definitely value in this approach, and it goes further than simple summarizing. For example, they talk about CRDTs being like tiny chefs that keep your recipes in check, and ended the podcast with "Umai shows us that Solid is a vision worth striving for. A vision where we can all have our cake and eat it too. And have the recipe for it. Securely stored in our POD.". I couldn't have said it better myself!

    Going through this, I also experimented with hosting my own podcast and generating the RSS feed from scratch. It was easier than I expected, and I also learned about [RSS styles](https://www.rss.style/) which are pretty neat. If you're curious to listen to the episode, you can plug this in your favorite podcast app (or click to listen in the browser): [noeldemartin.com/podcast/feed.xml](https://noeldemartin.com/podcast/feed.xml).

- Consuming other's content.

    This one is more tricky, because I'm wary of consuming content through AI summaries. If anything, my experience trying to create one from my own content has confirmed that they hallucinate, and they leave interesting stuff out. But the truth is that there is some content that I'm never going to consume anyways, so I may as well get the AI summary and dig into anything I find interesting myself. For example, I have thousands of articles in my Read Later list, and I have hundreds of books I would like to have read. I struggle to fit reading time in my schedule, but I listen to a lot of podcasts.

    The only trouble I envision is that they could become repetitive and formulaic. Even though I was floored by the first podcasts it generated, after a few iterations I'm starting to see the patterns. Hopefully, generating them from content that I haven't written will make them more interesting.

Something else I've been playing with is [ActivityPods](https://activitypods.org/). I've known about the project for a while, and it is apparently [the most actively developed open source Solid project](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/inrupts-data-wallet/7836/10#:~:text=I%20have%20high%20hopes%20for%20activitypods%2C%20which%20is%20currently%20the%20most%20actively%20developed%20open%20source%20Solid%20project). I refrained from using it because it wasn't compatible with Solid yet. However, taking another look at [their documentation on Solid compatibility](https://activitypods.org/specs/solid), it seemed like it was pretty close to supporting everything I need in my apps. So I decided to take a stab at it.

You'll have to wait for my next update for a final report, because I'm still tinkering with it. But my initial impression is that it isn't as close as I thought :(. I'm not familiar with the internals of the project, so I can't know how difficult it will be to bridge the gap. But I can say that in its current form, it's still very far from being a spec-compliant Solid POD. And it's not just about "being spec-compliant", I tried to make my apps work with their server, even if I had to write code specific to their implementation (which I'm very much against). But I found countless roadblocks. Just to name a few: Inrupt's auth library doesn't work, using SAI is not optional, documents can only contain triples with the same subject, Turtle support is subpar, etc.

To their credit, I'll say that they intend to fix these problems, and [S√©bastien](https://github.com/srosset81) has been helping me triage them. But as things stand, I don't think my apps are going to work with ActivityPods anytime soon. However, with a lot of hacking, I did manage to get my [Ramen](https://ramen.noeldemartin.com/) app working. I'm still unsure if I'll add these hacks to the codebase, because it's just too much, and it'd be a lot more work to get any of my "real" apps working. But this also gave me a chance to finally look at [SAI](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/).

I've also been aware of SAI for a long time (years, even). But I hadn't taken a look for a couple of reasons. First of all, like most specs in the ecosystem, it's still a draft. The same is true for [type indexes](https://solid.github.io/type-indexes/) though, and I'm using them. The crucial difference is that SAI is not a client-client standard, so it needs server-side support in order to work. And when it comes to adopting bleeding edge features, I'm usually quite conservative. I think of it like [using new CSS properties according to browser support](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/browser-support/). And at this point, almost no Solid servers support SAI.

But I _am_ interested, so I used the opportunity to take a look. And the first impressions weren't great either üòÖ. In fact, I can only say that I started reading the spec, and it was so filled with jargon that I had to leave it aside and just duplicate what [the sample ActivityPods app](https://docs.activitypods.org/tutorials/create-your-first-social-app/) was doing üôà. To be fair, I couldn't spend a lot of time looking at these things the last couple of weeks, I'll probably get it once I spend some more time going through the spec and other resources. But this wasn't my experience reading other specs in the past. [When I first learned about Solid](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-task-manager-using-solid), I read through the RDF, Turtle, LDP, and SPARQL specs; and found them pretty easy to grasp. Of course, as I kept working on Solid I got more nuance, and realized that I was making some wrong assumptions. But that didn't stop me from getting started. This reminds me a lot of Lea Verou's concept of [use case complexity curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY). If we ever get SAI standardized and supported by most servers, which I hope we do, I also hope that it doesn't become yet another barrier for newcomers.
