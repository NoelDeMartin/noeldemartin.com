Once again, [it's a wrap](https://iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/its-a-trap-pun-its-a-wrap-admiral-ackbar-star-wars-1363199217Z.jpg).

This year I didn't attend as many talks as other years (I'll have to catch up on the recordings), but one of the few I enjoyed the most wasn't even listed in my previous update. And that was [Take Your FOSS Project From Surviving To Thriving](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2741-take-your-foss-project-from-surviving-to-thriving/), from the Thunderbird team. Just the day before, I attended the [OFFDEM Launch Party](https://oxygen.offdem.net/pub/tetraoxygen-launch-party-at-caldarium), and I was talking about the importance of having a path towards sustainability for Open Source projects (or any projects, really). I see many living off grants or, even worse, free labor. Which is fine at the beginning; but I think that's a very dangerous situation when a project has got some traction, or it has been going for a while. And that's exactly the main point of the talk. So if you're keen to learn more about this, check it out.

Another one of my highlights was, as expected, the [Open Source Design devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/open-source-design/). I've come to enjoy Penpot's talks a lot (I also attended [Penpot FEST](https://penpotfest.org/) back in July), and [this year's talk](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3509-penpot-2-0-is-here-/) was no exception. In particular, I was very happy to hear about applying a declarative vs imperative approach to Design. I think the Penpot team are doing a great job, and I'm very inspired with their mission to bring Developers and Designers together.

[My own lightning talk about Moodle](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2167-moodle-empowering-educators-to-improve-our-world/) went well, and I was suprised with a round of applause in the middle of it. This happened after bringing up that this was the first talk about Moodle in the 24 years of FOSDEM (which is, concidentally, as old as Moodle itself). So I guess a lot of people are already familiar with Moodle, but it seems like its Open Source nature and everything else we're doing is not as well known. Hopefully, this will inspire others to talk more about Moodle in FOSDEM!

Besides attending the talks, I also met a couple of interesting people. In particular, I had many talks with and about the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl). I was already familiar with them and some of the projects they've funded, but I realized they've done a lot more than I thought (I learned they even [funded Mastodon](https://nlnet.nl/project/Mastodon/)!). It was interesting to hear they opinion about the Solid ecosystem and where it's going, and I've finally got my hands on some [Solid stickers](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/111867255069959661).

Finally, this year I was able to end the trip with a visit to [my favourite sandwich shop](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tonton+garby); and I can confirm it's still as delightful as ever. Mission accomplished!
