It's taken me a long time to post this update because I've been busy [attending FOSDEM](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem-2020), [preparing a talk on Solid](https://speakerdeck.com/noeldemartin/an-introduction-to-solid) and as I'll explain later, solving some technical challenges. On the flip side I've implemented an [RSS feed](https://noeldemartin.com/now/rss.xml) for these updates, maybe that's where you are reading this :).

As I mentioned on my last update, I've been pondering how to model watch actions in this application. Given that I needed to solve a new use-case, I decided to revisit the [Solid docs](https://solidproject.org/for-developers/apps) and I'm glad to say they've improved. I also noticed I am neglecting setting up the [Type Registry](https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/master/proposals/data-discovery.md#type-index-registry) in my applications, that's something I'll have to fix at some point. The conclusion I reached after learning how others are handling similar use-cases is that I should create a new relationship in [soukai-solid](https://github.com/noeldemartin/soukai-solid). As I suspected, watch actions should not be LDP Resources, although they'll be RDF Resources (because [all rdf entities are](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)). I hope this doesn't get confusing, basically LDP Resources are documents (they have their own url), and any other entities that don't map to a document will be plain RDF Resources. In modeling this I've called this non-document entities [Embedded Resources](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/tree/429ff6c40025604e673a677cc3bd62a7fd0f0a79#embedded-resources), and the new relationship can declared using `embeds` and `isEmbeddedBy`. Since they are within an existing document they can't have their own url. I've solved this by using the url fragment (which I think is a standard practice in Solid). For example, if I have a movie with uuid `12345` at `https://my-pod.com/movies/12345` the identifier for a watch action with uuid `abc` on that movie would be `https://my-pod.com/movies/12345#abc`.

Other than the reasons I've mentioned at the beginning, this has also taken me a couple of weeks in real-time because library development and app development are completely different. When I'm developing library code (soukai and soukai-solid), I have to be careful not to break existing functionality. I also need to make sure that every new feature is congruent with the library. But I think it's a worthy effort because that will allow me to make applications faster (and I plan to make many :D). This may cause this task to go beyond my initial appetite, but I consider that this library work is outside the scope of the task anyways.
