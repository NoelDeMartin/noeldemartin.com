After looking over my notes, I decided to publish some of them in a [blog post](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/lessons-learned-musashi-by-eiji-yoshikawa). I'd have liked to use some images from the manga Vagabond, but I couldn't find anything good that was available without copyright infringements. So I ended up using the image that's found in Musashi's wikipedia page. But you should [check them out](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vagabond+takehiko+inoue+illustrations&atb=v1-1&t=h_&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)!

I see myself coming back to review this book at some point, because it was so awesome. But for now, that's it for this Task.
