Lesson 9 completed, only one left!

This time Seth asked us to write a business plan. I have to say, I have a love/hate relationship with business plans. They can be one of the best things you do to provide clarity or they can be one of the worst things to derrail you from your focus.

But the way Seth presented it is good :). For this workshop I chose to explore the possibility of creating an arquitecture of federated storage on the web (you can read more about it on [this task](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-task-manager-using-solid)). The problem I'm identifying is of course monetization, given that this is more a pet project than something I want to generate revenue with. But the lessons learned on this workshop are still valuable. In terms of knowing how to do bootstrapping in the future and how to better tackle my side projects.
