I just completed the last thing I needed to consider this task done: A logo!

Yeah, I know.

Anyways, at this point I consider this finished and I'll use the PWA for a while to see if it works as expected "in production". You can find it [here](https://noeldemartin.github.io/solid-focus). I'll probably continue adding some features here and there.

As per my conclusions regarding Solid. I can't say I've reached any definitive conclusion yet, but I have learned quite a bit. I now have a better feel for how working with Solid's like. It's clear that it's still a very early stage for the project, a lot of essential pieces are still in development and I haven't seen a lot of activity outside of the core community. But the goals are aligned with what I wanted to achieve when I was developing my protocol, so I'll continue working on Solid for a while.

There are a couple of things that worry me and I'll have to continue digging into:

- Finding RDF Schemas and ontologies was more difficult than I expected, and I'm not entirely happy with the current definitions I am using. This worries me because I consider a "task manager" to be a use case common enough that I expected definitions for this to be established. Of course I can always create my own definitions or mix and match from different schemas, but that kills the idea I had of interoperability.
- The learning curve and the community are not great at the moment. This can be attributed to being at an early stage, but if this doesn't change some years from now I can't see Solid becoming something that anyone else besides enthusiasts use. And that would be a bad sign. If this doesn't happen with Solid given the exposure and people behind it, it won't happen with anything else that tackles data ownership.
