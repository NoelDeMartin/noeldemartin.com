I've wanted to have a [mini-life](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/mini-lives/) for a long time, but for one thing or another I've been postponing it. Don't worry though, this site won't become a travel blog; it's just that sometimes I find it interesting to talk about [other things I'm doing](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/growing-vegetables).

Even though I've been working remotely for years now, this will be the first time I'll be doing it from a different country. To be honest, the nomad life is not appealing to me, but I do like traveling and experiencing other cultures. This should be a good way to take advantage of the situation.

There are many countries I could have chosen to start, but Japan had to be the first (I'm sure you already noticed how much I like japanese culture). I already went some years ago for holidays, but it felt short and I was mostly moving around. This time, I hope to experience more of the daily life and connect with some local communities (although I'll also be on holidays for the second half of my trip).

On that note, if you know of any meetups or some place I should visit let me know! I'll be looking for programming or entrepreneurship communities, but I guess if I can't find any I can always try some language exchange.
