The Symposium is officially over, and if I had to compress my experience to a single sentence I would say that I got drunk on excitement.

Yes, I also had a couple of beers (we were in Belgium, after all). But the conversations were a lot more stimulating than the alcohol. It was awesome meeting so many people from the Solid community, old and new, and discuss about all sort of topics. Here's a list of some things I talked about:

- Students as ideal potential members of the Solid community (and teachers as the best way to reach them).
- [NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/) (as ever, they seem to be funding a lot of projects from the community).
- Adding more social aspects to my apps (both for people who enjoy sharing their movie-watching/cooking habits, and to create network effects).
- A Solid Pod acting as a proxy for file-based cloud providers (Nextcloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).
- Local-first interoperability (different apps working together with the local data).
- DefinitelyShaped (I'll let you guess what that means).
- etc.

I've never been as excited about Solid as I am now. We still have some [important problems to overcome](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/112370779671779713), but I think most of us at the Symposium were aligned with the direction we want to take. So I'm hopeful for the future.

Also, I did enjoy the talks and learned a thing or two! In particular, I really enjoyed the second part of the Real Time Solid session. I first shared my very simple, yet effective, approach to making CRDTs work with Solid. And then, [George](https://github.com/gsvarovsky) and [Michael](https://invisible.college/@toomim) took it up a notch with their real hardcore CRDTs, [m-ld](https://m-ld.org/) and [Braid](https://braid.org/).

And that would be it for this task, but as I mentioned I plan on releasing a recording of my talks for the people who couldn't attend. I should get that done within the next couple of weeks.
