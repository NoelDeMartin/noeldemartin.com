I just finished reading this book and it's for sure one of the best I've ever read. I'm even considering replacing my favourite book: the Sherlock Holmes Anthology. But it's too soon to say.

I'm not closing the task yet because I want to review the notes I took and do some summary. The book is very long and there are a ton of gems within, so it's only fair to take some time to digest it.
