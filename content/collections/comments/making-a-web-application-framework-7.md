I've been leaving this task on the side for some weeks, but today I'm back. And I intend to be _almost_ finished with the rebuilt by the end of the cycle (more on that later).

Now, it's not like I've been doing nothing. In fact, I've been tinkering with the UI a lot; and I decided on the style I'm going to use. But it wasn't easy to get there, because I've been struggling with an issue that has been on the back of my mind for a while.

Basically, I really like the idea of [doorless apps](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01evv3hq1ak4b6ng1jzppx5n2j). That's one of the reasons why mine don't have intricate landing pages. People can start using them right away, without even creating an account, so I haven't spent any time trying to convince anyone. The barrier to entry is so low, I figured, that everyone landing on the apps would just start using them. However, I've always been aware of how uninviting that is. There are some doorless apps like [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) that make it immediately obvious. But that's not the case with the current design of my apps.

So when I started thinking on the landing page for this one, I had two options. Either go full doorless and drop people on some empty state, or make a "real" landing page. As fate would have it, I started taking Jack McDade's [Radical Design Course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com/) in the middle of making this decision. And after some experiments, I've decided to make a real landing page. I'm very excited to share it with everyone, but I don't think I'll show it until I release the final version ðŸ¤«. For now, I'll only say that I've been using [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus) and [Penpot](https://penpot.app/), and it will be radically different from any of my other apps.

If I don't add some structure to this, though, this process of tinkering with UI can drag on indefinitely. So today I'm kicking of the next cycle. It will end on June 28th, and my idea is to have the app completely finished by then. However, there are some things I'll still need to do before releasing it, such as migrating data from the legacy version. Because of that, this doesn't mean that I'll release the app by then. But it should take me much closer to the finish line.
