I have a love/hate relationship with courses and educational resources. The ones I like, [I like a lot](https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1325162606726967301). But I struggle to find the ones worth putting my time and money into. We have something called EduCash at [Moodle HQ](https://moodle.com/about/), which is a training allowance given to employees to spend in these type of courses. And for the 3 years I've been at Moodle, this is the first time I've used it! So that tells you how excited I am to take it :).

I first heard about this course from [Adam Wathan's recommendation](https://artofproductpodcast.com/episode-218), and after checking it out I read [one of Josh's posts](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/). That really sealed the deal for me. Actually, if you're reading this and want to learn more, I strongly suggest that you check out the articles on [his blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). There are lot of free resources in there that I'm sure you'll find very useful.

So far, I've only taken the introduction and a recap of the fundamentals. I didn't get into it intending to journal about it, but right off the bat he's encouraging students to learn in public. So I had no excuse üòÇÔ∏è.

The fundamentals module is a quick overview of the basics of CSS, which of course I already knew. But it's still been useful to clarify some nomenclature, and I even learned a couple of things. I learned about the [:last-of-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) pseudoselector, and that you can use shift+click in the developer tools to switch between color representations (hex, rgb, hsl, etc.). I also found out that you can see the contrast ratio of colors in the picker, which I hadn't noticed. So I'm sure those will be useful at some point.
