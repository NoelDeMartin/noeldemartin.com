I started the day attendimg the talk about software freedom, since I didn't make it in time for the keynote. It was interesting to see the struggles of trying to live without proprietary software. I didn't know the speakers, but I will look at their work at the [ Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

After that I went to the decentralization/privacy room and I didn't leave it the whole day! I expect to look around tomorrow and visit some stands.

The talks I enjoyed the most were [Exodus](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/analysis_of_the_behavior_of_mobile_applications_and_its_consequences_for_our_privacy/), [YunoHost](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/yunohost/) and the [ActivityPub panel](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/activitypub_panel/). I also took the chance to salute Elliot from [FunkWhale](https://funkwhale.audio). I really like his project and I'll probably host my own instance at some point.
