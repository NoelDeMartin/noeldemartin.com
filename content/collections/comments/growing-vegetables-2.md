Here's a short update on what's happening with the plants.

TLDR: They've grown a lot, but still no fruit. I've learned more rookie mistakes. Scroll below for pictures.

So, as you'll see on the pictures below, the plants have grown a lot, and I'm very happy about that :). For a first-time gardener like me, it's awesome to see what started as a bunch of seeds growing into such big and beautiful plants.

But, I'm still not sure that it's going as well as it should. For one, I've been told that I should have separated some of the plants. In particular, the Tomatoes that seem to be growing the best are in a bundle of 3 jammed together and that's not good. I tried to separate them, but they were too tangled up and I was afraid to kill them if I tampered too much. So I just moved them into a dedicated container. The Jalapeños seem to be growing fine and don't have this problem so far, but I think they've been stagnant for a while.

But recently, the Tomatoes started growing some flowers so I think that's a good sign and maybe I'll finally get to enjoy some fruits :D.

Other than the plants I already mentioned last time, I've planted a new batch of Basil and this one's survived the transplant so that's nice. I also planted a couple of lettuce, but only one sprouted and it seems to be surviving so far, but I'm not sure it's doing great. We'll see.

Something I've realized I haven't done at all is trimming plants. The only thing I've done is planting, transplanting, and watering. I have also tied the tomatoes to a couple of sticks because I was told they need them (and it is quite windy up here), but that's all. I'm not sure if I should be tending them any other way. For example, I've been taking some leaves from the Basil and that wasn't a good idea, because [Basil is supposed to be harvested from the stem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVPnC6mGEsg) (not stripping the leaves). So the Basil has now started to grow flowers which is not ideal, but I'm just leaving it be to see how it goes.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy how it's going, and I think if everything goes well I should accomplish my goal of eating at least one piece of food grown from seed. Although I'm seeing that I may have some issues in August, because I'll probably leave for a week or two and I have to find a way to keep the plants alive. I'm thinking that I could install an automatic watering system, but I'm not sure how feasible that is because I don't have any water outlets near the balcony. Another option would be to ask someone to check on them, but I don't want to inconvenience anyone and many of my friends will be on holidays as well. I still have a couple of months to think about it, so we'll see.

Here's some pictures of what's been going on:
