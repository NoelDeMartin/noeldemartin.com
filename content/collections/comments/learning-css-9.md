I can't believe I started this course in 2022. But after almost a year and a half, I'm done!

I haven't dedicated a lot of time every week, but I've been pretty consistent in dedicating 1 hour/week. In total I would say it took me around 60~70 hours. Which is a lot of content, and all of it engaging! You could certainly do it faster, but I'm glad I took my time to go through the lessons at my own pace and absorb the concepts properly.

I don't have much to say about the last module other than it was a bunch of small fun things. Design tips, colors, shadows, mobile UX, etc. The name of the module says it all, actually: Little Big Details.

Now, after having finished the course, I can say it without reservation: this is the best course I've ever taken, and I think it should be mandatory for anyone working in the frontend. Sure, you can get by without this knowledge (like I did for 10 years), but if you're dedicating even 5% of your time to CSS, I'd say [it's totally worth it](https://xkcd.com/1205/). Also, [like the best courses do](https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1325352909966626816), it changed my mindset; and I don't think I'll ever see CSS the same way again.

And I don't think I'm really done with it, either, because there is a bunch of links and extra content I still have to explore. Not to mention reading more of [Josh's blog posts](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). Nevertheless, I'll close this task because otherwise I'd never be done. Though it's also left me wanting more. Not about CSS exactly; I'm not saying the course should be even longer. But I still want to learn more about making my apps more fun, more whimsical, and more engaging. And I've already started working on that.

One the one hand, I recently started Jack McDade's [Radical Design Course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com). I've actually watched all the videos already, and I enjoyed them a lot! But I'm still in the process of applying the lessons learned. You'll probably see the fruits of my labour when I publish my [Solid Focus Rebuild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awaaSorMYhk). I'm not going to do a full review for this course though, but my TLDR is that it's also a great course and I recommend that you watch [this video on curation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxwBNOku1bo) if you're interested. One drawback I'd mention is that it's mostly focused on landing pages, and I'm more interested in application UI. But it's already inspired me to do something interesting with my apps, which I'm looking forward to share with everyone. And many of the concepts taught can be applied to any type of design work.

On the other hand, I also started Emil Kowalski's [Animations on the web](https://animations.dev/) course. But I can't say much about this one, given that it's still being built ðŸ˜…. The contents from the first module are very similar to what I already learned about animations in Josh's course, so I'm sure the upcoming modules will be a lot more revealing.
