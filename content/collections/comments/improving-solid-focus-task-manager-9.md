Well, the updated docs are finished for now. I've put more effort in the Soukai docs than the Solid application, but I think that's fine. I consider Soukai to be a foundation for what the Solid app will become, as well as for other upcoming applications. And it's important to have strong foundations.

What I will do now to finally complete this task (4 months ongoing already!) is implement a couple of new features. It'll also be a good test to see if the foundations are really strong or not. The new features I plan to add should already be supported with the current status of the Soukai library, so let's see how it goes.
