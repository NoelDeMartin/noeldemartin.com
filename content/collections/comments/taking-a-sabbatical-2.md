It's been a month since I started the sabbatical, and so far it's going well. Being August, and the first month of the sabbatical, it felt like holidays as usual. But I'm happy to say that I've also been doing some coding, and I haven't been completely afk.

My intention is stil to blend the two, but I've decided that I'll separate these updates in Life stuff and Tech stuff. That way, if you're only interested in the tech stuff, you can skip all the ramblings about my personal life.

#### Life Stuff

As I'm writing this, I'm still in Spain. But the preparations are made to leave for Singapore on September 6th (this Friday). I'll be spending a couple of days there before moving to Malaysia; and so far, I don't have any plans beyond that.

This past month has been pretty chill overall. I spent some time at home, did some mini-trips around Catalonia, and went camping for a week in Asturias.

That last one was interesting, because it was my first time camping by myself (I actually did it with my partner, but I mean without parents). It's something I've wanted to do for a while, but for one reason or another we always stayed in hotels or [albergues](https://www.alberguescaminosantiago.com/). I'm very attracted to this type of lifestyle, because I do agree that we have [a comfort crisis](https://peterattiamd.com/michaeleaster/). I also started reading [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art), which has been excellent so far. So camping and doing the [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) have been very valuable experiences. But always that I've done these, it's been completely divorced from my work because I never bring my laptop along. I guess the real test will begin in Asia, because this time I intend to do it, and it'll be for an extended period of time.

Right now, I'm going through a mix of excitement and anxiety. Excitement because I've been looking forward to this for a long time, and anxiety because I worry too much about the future and "planning stuff". But whenever I think about it, I realize I have a priviledged life without any real problems. I have to learn to live more in the present!

#### Tech Stuff

Whenever I thought about my sabbatical in the past, I assumed I'd have infinite time to do everything in my TODO list. But of course, that didn't happen. In fact, I've realized something. When you say you're in a sabbatical, everyone around you also assumes you have all the time in the world, and they don't respect your time as much. However, if you say you're self-employed (even if you aren't earning a single cent), people take your "work time" more seriously. So maybe this whole sabbatical thing was a mistake ðŸ˜…. But I still think it's an experiment worth pursuing, we'll see how it goes.

All of that to say, that I no longer have any hopes of making any real progress in this sabbatical :/. But not to sound too grim, I found something better: building Proofs of Concept (or "Spikes" as some call them). There are many ideas I've had in mind for ages, but never started because the task seemed too daunting. But this month, I gave a couple of them a chance and I was pleasantly surprised.

One of those has been [building a Solid Server from scratch](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/113005202062248847). This is obviously not something I'll complete in the sabbatical. In fact, [it's one of my ideas for a full-time project](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/the-end-of-the-chapter#the-plan). But following the spirit of doing whatever I feel like, I just started typing away. And [I got it working in a single day](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/112973165563565020). I'm not sure how far I'll take this, but I'm very excited about it and I may continue tinkering with it during these months.

Something else I worked on was animations. For a while, I've heard from many people I admire that [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is one of the few reasons why they aren't using Vue (such as [Josh Comeau](https://x.com/JoshWComeau/status/1567559618062082048) and [Adam Wathan](https://x.com/adamwathan/status/1690044392533372949)). And since I started taking [Emil Kowalski's course on animations](https://animations.dev), I decided it was a good time to start playing with this. So I created a library (for now a folder in a project) called [Vivant](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/tree/aerogel/src/vivant). Again, this is not something I will finish in the sabbatical (or maybe ever), but it was fun to start tinkering. Ironically, it wasn't as easy as implementing a Solid Server from scratch, but I've already implemented a couple of animations in [Focus](https://focus.noeldemartin.com/) and it seems to be working well:
