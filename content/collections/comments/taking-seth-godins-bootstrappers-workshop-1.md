Today I completed lesson 7 (of 10). One of the main points that made me ponder was thinking about "status". Seth has a [whole podcast episode](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/episode-2-status-roles) talking about this, and looking back I realize I need to listen again because I didn't learn properly.

I assumed this doesn't affect me as much, because I try not to make decisions or let myself be influenced by "status" (I think that's similar to discrimination). Like Seneca [said](https://www.quotes.net/quote/8847):

> I shall never be ashamed of citing a bad actor if the line is good.

I try to judge and make decisions based on a fundamental level, not the source.

But the reality is that I am affected by this, even if it is on a subsconcious level. And status are not only limited to what I thought, affiliations and feeling identified with something is part of the "status roles" Seth talks about. It's also important to be aware and understand them if I want my work to help other people.

So yes, I'll listen to that episode again.
