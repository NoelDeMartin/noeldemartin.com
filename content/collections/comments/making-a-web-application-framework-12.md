It finally happened, the new and improved version of Focus is live and ready for production! Check it out at [focus.noeldemartin.com](https://focus.noeldemartin.com).

The most relevant difference you will notice from the beta is, of course, the landing page. About a year ago, I took Jack McDade's [Radical Design Course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com/), and I realized that landing pages in my apps were... well, not great. This time, I decided to kick it up a notch and give people some reasons to use the app. I wasn't doing this before because my apps are [doorless](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01evv3hq1ak4b6ng1jzppx5n2j). It's so easy to start using them, I thought, that the product would speak for itself. But that isn't how things work, and it doesn't hurt to "sell" the app a bit. It's also quite fun to make landing pages, and once again, even though I'm not a designer, I enjoy these things.

Other than that, there isn't much else that you wouldn't have seen before. Overall, I'm quite happy with the result, and I've been using it in production myself for months. Like always, though, there are a couple of things I'm still not completely happy with.

One of them is animations. Ever since [working on Umai](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-recipes-manager-using-solid#comment-19), I haven't been completely happy with the way I coded my animations. This time, I explored a bit more options, and created [Vivant](https://noeldemartin.github.io/vivant/). But I'm not convinced yet that this is The Way, and a few months ago [Motion for Vue](https://motion.dev/blog/introducing-motion-for-vue) came out. So I'm looking forward to continue experimenting with this in the future. And in particular, I'm looking forward to taking Josh W. Comeau's [Whimsical Animations Course](https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/). If it's half as good as his [CSS course](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/learning-css), it'll solve all my problems with animations.

Something else I'm wary of is the synchronisation mechanism. As I said, I've been using the app for months and it's working fine. But every now and then, some issue comes up, and it isn't super easy to debug. Fortunately, what worries me is not that I'm going to lose anyone's data, but it often [duplicates data](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/issues/18#issuecomment-2922660744), and the performance isn't great. The performance is not something I can improve too much given the limitations of Solid, but the duplicates and bugs are completely my fault. Still, I have finally encapsulated this logic in an external package (Aerogel), so it should get a lot better which each app I built. In the same way that Soukai has been improving, and it's been a while since I found any important bugs.

So yes, Focus is done, but what about this task? Long story short, I'm not closing it yet ðŸ˜…. _Technically_, the framework has been released and it's stable (you can create an app yourself doing `npm create aerogel my-project`). But I still haven't written any documentation, and there are still a couple of things I want to do before releasing the framework officially. And one of them, is Vibe Coding a bit ðŸ™ˆ. Wait, Vibe Coding!? Let's rewind a bit.

If you've only been reading this task, you may have missed [my presentation at the Solid Symposium last month](https://noeldemartin.com/solid-symposium-2025), and a couple of [links I shared in social media](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/114522294478215946). TLDR, the programming world is changing, and even though I'm not an AI maximalist (nor an AI doomer), I do think it is going to affect the way we make apps in the future. And I think Solid could play an important role in this new world. How cool would it be that every application made with AI happens to work with each other out of the box? And what if these applications also happen to give users ownership of their data and privacy by default? Of course, that's what would happen if they use Solid. Unfortunately, most of them are built with React and some old fashioned database like Supabase. So I think we're at a crucial point in shaping what the future of apps will look like.

Sadly, I won't be able to do much about it :(. I already talked about [my struggles to secure funding for my work](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/the-soul-crushing-reality-of-job-seeking#the-nlnet-fiasco), and so I'm back to working on this on the side. And I don't even have a 4-day workweek anymore. So yeah, I'll continue moving at a glacial pace over here. It is what it is.

In any case, my idea for now is to continue exploring how to build apps in the new age of software, and I want to make Aerogel a great companion for anyone who wants to do it as well (even [barefoot developers](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software)!). If nothing else, it should empower me to keep making [personal apps](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/shows-tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-a-personal-app).
