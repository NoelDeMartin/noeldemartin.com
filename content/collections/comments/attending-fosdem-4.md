Yesterday after the conference ended, I went to an IPFS meetup. I didn't know much about IPFS, so it was a good change to understand it better and meet new people.

One thing in particular that got my attention was [IPLD](http://ipld.io/), InterPlanetary Linked Data. Given my work with Solid, it'd be interesting to try and create a POD that stores data using IPFS combined with this. I still need to look into it more in depth, but at first glance seems like it would be possible by having a gateway/proxy that does the conversion between ipfs and Solid operations. Actually it isn't anything so uncommon, because that's exactly what a web server is doing, translating Solid operations into database or filesystem operations.
