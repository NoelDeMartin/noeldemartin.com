The point of the sabbatical is that I don't have any goals, but I'll use this task to share my experience. Similar to what I did in [my recent trip to Japan](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/working-from-japan).

In a way, this will be a simulation for my retirement (which is definitely decades away ðŸ˜…). In my recent mini-life in japan, I divided my trip into 2 distinct chunks: 3 weeks working remotely, and 3 weeks on holidays. This time, I intend to blend the two, and see what my life is like when I don't have to work for a living. Honestly, I don't think I'll be on holiday mode all the time, because I do enjoy my work and I don't like the idea of spending months without programming. But I also won't be traveling alone, and both of us will be unemployed, so I'm sure that will skew our tendencies.

The current plan is to spend most of August in Spain, which is usually a time where most people around here is on holidays, and fly to Asia in early September. We don't have many plans beyond that, and we'll probably fly to wherever is more convenient. So far, Singapore seems like a good starting point.
