I have completed a first version were both offline and Solid storages are working locally, but the application is throwing an error when logging with my solid.community account. So I'll have to see what's different from my local Solid server for development.

I have also deployed a version to github pages, so if you are curious to see how it looks you can visit this page: [noeldemartin.github.io/solid-focus](https://noeldemartin.github.io/solid-focus/). But keep in mind that you'll just be able to use the offline option at the moment. I'll post an update when I get it working correctly!
