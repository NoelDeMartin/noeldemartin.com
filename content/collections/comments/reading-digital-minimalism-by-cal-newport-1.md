I can't keep myself from commenting on the irony that was not being able to get a book called "Digital Minimalism" in a "minimal" format. My reading experience is already quite simple, I read PDFs highlighting excerpts and extract them to Evernote. I recently started [reading a physical book](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-los-tonicos-de-la-voluntad-by-santiago-ramon-y-cajal) after some years, and it hasn't been optimal for the reasons I just mentioned.

Many times, even if I buy a book, I'll end up downloading a PDF for reading. In this instance not only was it impossible, I also wasn't able to get it anywhere other than Amazon. So I ended up installing the Kindle app on my phone.

Maybe this happened because I don't usually read books as they come out, I'm always reading books that are at least some months old (if not years). I'll use this opportunity to learn what's the experience of reading on the Kindle app. But I don't think it'll go beyond this one experience, specially after seeing [Exodus' privacy report](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/56733/).
