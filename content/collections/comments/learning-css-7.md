I didn't think I'd be posting any more updates this year, but I finished the Grid module just in the nick of time!

At first, this module seemed shorter than usual. But when I got [to the workshop](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/css-for-js-workshop-7), I realized I was wrong. It's definitely been one of the longest workshops of the course, but I cannot say I've enjoyed it tremendously. In fact, I don't think I have enjoyed any of the workshops too much. They are quite good nonetheless, but compared to the enjoyment of taking the lessons, they fall to average. I think the reason why I don't like them too much is that I feel like I have to do a lot of work for something I don't care too much about. And being forced to use Styled Components and React doesn't help, because I still don't like them :/. But I have to recognize that some times, it's necessary to roll up your sleeves and do the work to solidify the concepts learned. Though I enjoy the small exercises in lessons a lot more, and I'm thankful the entire course is not like this.

Anyhow, besides the slog of a workshop, I also enjoyed this lesson overall. I haven't been using grid much, and as is becoming tradition in this course, I noticed how little I knew about it. But this time, I'm not sure I'll be using this too much, because I feel like I can do mostly everything with Flex. Though I'm sure there will be some situations where grid will come in handy. If you want to learn about it yourself, Josh recently published a blog post going over the basic concepts: [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/).

And that's mostly everything I have to say about grid, but in the periphery of taking this module I read a couple of his posts I'd like to mention:

- [Chasing the Pixel-Perfect Dream](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/pixel-perfection/)
- [Effective Collaboration with Product and Design](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/career/effective-collaboration/)

The first one tackles exactly the point I mentioned in my last update about pixel-perfection. Other than learning pure CSS, these are the things that are making this course so interesting to me. I am a developer who enjoys design, but unfortunately I don't do as much of it as I'd like. And learning about things like [designing on top of a screenshot](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1715403911106879554) is golden. The second one tackles collaboration with designers, and I've always thought that the work I've enjoyed the most in my carreer has been working alongside designers. I hope I can do a lot more of that in the future.

When I started this task I wouldn't have believed [I'd still be working on it a year later](https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1726665113099534669). In the course FAQs Josh mentions that it should take an average of 40 hours to complete, and so far I've spent more than 50. But if anything, I have to say that's a good thing, because I'm still enjoying it like the first day. What's even more amazing, is that the last two modules could be the ones I enjoy the most: Animations and Little Big Details. And they also seem to be some of the longer ones! So there is still plenty of juice to squeeze.
