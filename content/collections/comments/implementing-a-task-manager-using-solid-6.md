And it's done! The app is working both locally and using my solid.community account. You can head to the [github repo](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus) if you want to check it out.

I'm still not closing this task because there are still some things to improve (globbing for better performance, UI tweaks, RDF types, etc.). But I would say the most important part has been finished.

Once I've completed what's left I'll close this and head to gitter and my socials to ask for feedback.
