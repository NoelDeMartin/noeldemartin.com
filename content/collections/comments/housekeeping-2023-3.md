The last thing I wanted to do before calling it for this task was to review my entire backlog of tasks (which, as you can imagine, is enormous üòÖÔ∏è).

I've been thinking a better way to work on what really matters, rather than [getting stuck on neverending tasks](/tasks/implementing-a-recipes-manager-using-solid#comment-23-p-7). [My current system](https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1329809105272377348) is a bit crude, and I'm a big fan of [Eisenhower's Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). So it would be nice to introduce something like that to my workflow. But at this point I don't think automating it [would be worth it](https://xkcd.com/1205/). For now, I'll leave it as is. Maybe [when I revamp Solid Focus](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/issues/10) will be a great time to add some new features related to that. If I manage to honor this year's focus on simplicity, it should be fine.

In any case, after grooming the entire backlog the only thing I decided to do within the scope of this task was brushing up on `noeldemartin.com`. I still have a lot more to do; like migrating to a headless architecture and such. But I worked on a couple of improvements I've had in mind for a while. One you may be interested in is that I added a new [/talks](/talks) page to the site, where I list all the talks I've given.

And with that, that's it for the task! I'll go ahead and close it, and you should see my next "real task" soon.
