It has taken longer than I expected, but I'm finally done with my [Calories Tracker](https://calories.noeldemartin.com/). Before I get into that, though, there's a couple of things I want to mention.

First, in case you missed it, I joined the Local-first community meetup to talk about Solid. It was fun! [You can find the recording in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/GDQMLt3oqio?t=246s). If you've seen my other talks, there's probably nothing new here. But one slide in particular is interesting, because I came up with [My 3 ideals for software](https://noeldemartin.com/slides/local-first-solid-and-everything-in-between?slide=19). I've had these in my mind for a while, but it was helpful to write them down. Eventually, I would like to write a blog post about this as well. But I'm still starved for time, so that will have to wait.

Second, Tim's new book came out: [This Is For Everyone](https://thisisforeveryone.timbl.com). [I shared my thoughts in the Solid Forum](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/this-is-for-everyone/9987), but TLDR I really liked it. I was also very surprised to find that [this very blog is quoted in the book](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/115181321769573463) :D.

And third, it is Halloween! As a big movie buff, this is one of my favourite seasons of the year, because I watch Halloween movies non-stop. Though my definition of a "Halloween movie" is a bit loose, and anything that contains enough blood or is kind of dark, meets the bar. In any case, I'm writing this because I updated [Media Kraken](https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/) with some recommendations; and I also added a couple of easter eggs. If you also enjoy Halloween movies, check them out. And if there's any you like that I have missed, let me know :).

Ok, back to Aerogel. If we look at the timeline, I have been working on this Calories Tracker for almost 3 months. Which given my trajectory of year-long projects is not bad, but this was supposed to be "a quick one". However, I'm happy to say that Aerogel and Solid have _not_ been one of the blockers. Indeed, I can say Aerogel is living up to its goal, because I didn't have to think about Solid or RDF at all :D. Of course, there have been some bugs here and there; but for the most part I've been spending more time struggling with the UI and calorie tracking idiosyncrasies. If you're curious, check it out. But it _is_ a personal app, so you won't find it as intuitive and polished as my other apps. Eventually, I would also like to make a video about it. But again, I don't have much time affluence at the moment.

I've also continued experimenting with AI, and I can't say my opinion has changed much. It is very useful for some things, decent for making UI, and a complete waste of time for advanced functionality. Something I've been playing with since my last update is [spec-driven development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) and [Agent rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules), but those have been somewhat underwhelming because the AI is prone to blatantly ignore some of the instructions :/. Apparently, this is a known problem called "[Lost in the middle](https://www.aihero.dev/what-is-the-context-window#the-lost-in-the-middle-problem)". I'll continue exploring this, but I have to say that I agree with most of the things mentioned in this video: [AI Coding Sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZUkQF6boNg).

Finally, it's been a while since I talked about tooling, so here's an update.

Some months ago, I started using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and it really is awesome. I'm quite reticent to adding abstraction layers, that's why I never used yarn or any of the other package managers on top of npm... But trying pnpm was the right choice, because it works really well and it's giving me very few headaches. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to migrate the main Aerogel repository yet (because I tried, and it didn't work ðŸ˜…), but I'm sure I'll do it one of these days.

I also started using [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/), but my experience hasn't been great so far. The performance isn't great, and whenever I've had to debug something, I've realized that it adds a lot of intermediate components... Not sure if that's why the performance isn't great, but it certainly makes it harder to debug. I've also been using [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) at work, but it isn't much better. You may recall that I was using [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), but the Vue version is pretty much abandoned, so that isn't an option either. Honestly, I still love Vue and it's my favourite front-end framework (although I haven't tried Svelte), but this is the sort of stuff that makes people choose React. The ecosystem is, without a doubt, much better. Though to be fair, I still have to find a single component framework that I like; because my experience with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) wasn't great either. Maybe [Flux](https://fluxui.dev/) would be the one, but alas, I'm not doing much Laravel these days.

Some other tool I've been playing with recently is [Zod](https://zod.dev/). This one would also go into the "awesome" category, and I'm loving it. I've been slowly getting more into advanced Typescript patterns, and Zod is the perfect addition to such a codebase. If I had the time, I would refactor Soukai to use Zod in the schema definition â€” and maybe some day I will â€” but for now I'm just using it sparingly.

Finally, I've also been doing some testing, and I'm sad to say that I'm not so happy with Cypress these days. It's crashing more than usual, and I'm finding ever more weird bugs and workarounds. Recently though, I've been using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) in other projects, and it seems a lot more reliable. In a perfect world, I would also migrate all my tests to Playwright.

And that's mostly it for today's update!

Regarding this task's progress... It doesn't seem like I'm going to release Aerogel anytime soon. To be honest, what I lack the most at the moment is motivation and time. Technically, Aerogel already exists, and I'm using it in my projects. But it still needs some polish (and documentation) before an official release. However, I don't see a reason to work on that at the moment. For now, I'll keep tinkering with Personal Apps and we'll see how that goes. I guess this task will remain open until I finally release it, or decide that it's not going to happen.

On that note, I mentioned before how the Shows Tracker was getting out of hand, and I was facing some serious performance issues. In order to solve my own use-case, I have decided to dip my toes in a different ecosystem, so I'll build that one with a different stack. Hopefully, I won't face any performance issues. It'll also be nice to experience other frameworks and ecosystems to get some inspiration. We'll see how that goes.
