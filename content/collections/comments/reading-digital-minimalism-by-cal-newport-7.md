Chapter 5 goes into what forms of communication have appeared in the Internet age and how a Digital Minimalist should approach them. He distinguishes between conversation and connection, and says that we are losing conversations in favor of connections and they don't have the same depth for social interaction. Overall I agree with the ideas, but I'm not too keen on the practices he recommends.

The first one is to not click "like" in social media platforms, ever. I have a problem with that because I use likes primarily as acknowledgement. When I want to let someone know I've read their message but have nothing to say, I just click like. What he recommends instead is going completely silent, and that is something I cannot agree with. The part I agree with him and I'm already applying is not to use likes as part of a conversation nor social status.

The second thing he recommends is to consolidate texting, meaning not to be available 24/7 for texting and instead batching reading and replying to chats. This is something I do as well (I always have my phone in silent mode), but I don't agree with his assumption that people expect others to always be on call. I haven't had a problem with my aptitude, maybe it's because people already know me. But it's also true that sometimes I do have unscheduled real-time conversations over chat and I don't see a problem with that. I see where his point comes from, but I just think a person should be [conscious enough](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/order-vs-chaos) to know when to talk real-time and when to batch conversations.

The last thing he introduces is having office hours for conversations. I think this is a great thing to do at work, as a way to discourage interruptions, but I don't like the idea to have them in my personal life. I cannot think of any time I have on a daily schedule where I wouldn't mind being interrupted (that's why I dread phone calls so much). Instead I think scheduling meeting with friends or a call is much better. That way when I don't have anything scheduled I can focus on whatever I'm doing and not be on my toes knowing that anyone is expected to interrupt me.
