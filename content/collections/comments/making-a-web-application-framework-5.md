Hello, 2024!

I'm back from the holiday break, and I'm ready to get back on the horse. Some years, I've used this season to advance on my side-projects as well. But this time I made a pledge of not going near a keyboard (for programming purposes). So I've spend it mostly watching [movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112922/) and [TV shows](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764386/), [playing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/) [games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601150/Devil_May_Cry_5/), and visiting the land of the [Yule Lads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Christmas_folklore#Yule_Lads).

Right before the break though, I made an end of year gift for Solid developers: üéÅ [cypress-solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/cypress-solid). You may want to check that out!

Anyhow, now that I'm done with [all of new year's chores](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/105525557154075833), I'm ready to get on with this task. And after some thought, I've decided that revamping [Solid Focus](https://noeldemartin.github.io/solid-focus/) will be the next and final step. Admitedly, that will be cheating a bit, because I won't be releasing the framework after that (as in making an official announcement that it's "ready"). But I've had enough of [multi-year tasks](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-recipes-manager-using-solid), so I'll tackle the branding and documentation of the framework in a separate task. I will consider the framework's first draft done after I have a real app built with it.

Something I've noticed looking back at 2023 is that I haven't been doing [Shape Up cycles](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles) as of late. But I found them very useful for getting things done when tasks were running too long, so that's how I'll approach this revamp.

I'm kicking off a cycle today, and it should be done by March 1st. The scope for this cycle is to rebuild Solid Focus, from scratch, using AerogelJS. And yes, I mean a feature-complete rebuild. [It took me about 7 months](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/improving-solid-focus-task-manager) to build the previous version, but I'm a lot more experienced with Solid now, and the point of the framework is that it should allow me to be faster. So this should be a good stress-test. The framework is not finished, however, specially the offline-first approach which I'll want to add and is novel to Solid Focus. Because of that, I also don't want to be too optimistic, and I'm leaving some things out of the scope. In particular, I won't be tackling any of the data migration or branding improvements. Both of which I'll definitely look into before re-releasing the revamped app.
