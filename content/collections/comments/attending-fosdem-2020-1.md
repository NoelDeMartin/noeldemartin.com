I've been looking into the schedule and these got my attention:

**Friday**

- 16:00 onwards @ Delirium Café - [Beer event](https://fosdem.org/2020/beerevent/). Last year I also attended this event. The only bad thing I have to say is that it was too crowded, but hey I guess that's the cost of doing business.

**Saturday**

- 11:00-11:50 @ K.1.105 (La Fontaine) - [The Selfish Contributor Explained](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/selfish_contributor/)
- 13:00-13:50 @ K.1.105 (La Fontaine) - [Freedom and AI: Can Free Software include ethical AI systems?](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ethical_ai/)
- 15:00-15:30 @ UA2.220 (Guillissen) - [Building a Web App that Doesn’t Trust the Server](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_securing_protonmail/)

**Sunday**

- 10:35-10:55 @ UB5.230 - [The Ethics of Open Source](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ethicsoss/)
- 11:30-11:50 @ UB5.230 - [Building Ethical Software Under Capitalism](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/capitalismethicaloss/)

- 13:30-13:55 @ H.1302 (Depage) - [2nd Generation JavaScript Frameworks & Libraries: Beyond Angular, React, and Vue!](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/beyond_angular_react_vue/)
- 16:30-17:00 @ UA2.220 (Guillissen) - [Who will Decentralise the Fediverse?](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_decentralize_fediverse/)

This year it seems like there aren't as many talks that I want to see like last year, I am specially missing some talks about [Solid](https://solidproject.org). It's also true that last year I enjoyed many talks I hadn't noticed on the schedule.

On the flip side, this time I have some people I want to meet. I'm going with a friend from Barcelona, I am seeing some people I met last year and I'm also meeting some co-workers from [Moodle](https://moodle.org). So maybe this year I'll do more "networking" and I won't stay holed up in the Decentralized Internet and Privacy devroom like I did last time.
