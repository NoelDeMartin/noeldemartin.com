Chapter 4 introduces one of the practices encouraged for Digital Minimalists: Solitude. The idea resonates a lot with me, since I actually struggle on the opposite (scheduling time to interact with others). If anything I would like to increase my time alone. Keeping in mind the definition from the author as "mental solitude", I associate it a lot to [David Allen's concept of mental bandwidth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHxhjDPKfbY).

Once again he gets into too many examples, so I guess this will be the norm for the rest of the book. I think it's worth it because I'm enjoying the content, but I wouldn't discard reading a summary instead if I'd known beforehand.

The point he makes about solitude is quite persuading, although most people may find it difficult to take into practice. One particular concept he introduces that I found very interesting is what he calls "Solitude Deprivation". He argues it's a problem most people of modern society is starting to suffer, and it's backed by a direct correlation with kids born after the appearance of the smartphone and a huge increase in teen anxiety.

He finishes by prospecting three specific things to do: Leaving your phone at home, taking long walks and writting letters to yourself. All are valuable, but I can't help but notice how all of these are too biased to his own personal experience. Which isn't necessarily bad, but I think he presents some things in an unoptimal maner. For example, I believe the whole point of taking walks could be accomplished by meditation and reflecting, that can be more doable for most people.
