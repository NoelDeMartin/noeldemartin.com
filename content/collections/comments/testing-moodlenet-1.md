I've been visiting the platform at least once a day so far, and I've got the gist of its current status. The site is simple by design, since they are trying to validate core assumptions (it isn't production-ready yet). I definetly think this is the way to go about it, getting users involved as soon as possible.

My initial impressions have been good because it's easy to use, and it's clear what each section is for. But I've found something different to what I expected when I was talking about "storing my learning materials". The platform is built around resources and collections, but all of those are (at the moment) under the umbrella of a community. This is great for the social aspect, given that it can gather individuals intersted in a certain topic. But from a personal management of resources, it's kind of awkard.

For example, to get started I intended to gather some resources of technologies I like or want to learn more about: Solid, Laravel and Vue. In order to publish any resource or collection, a community has to be created, so I created one called "Vue Developers". And the problem I see with that is that it isn't my intention to create a community of Vue developers. The connotations of a "community" go way beyond what I'm trying to do with those resources, at least at the moment. And if someone really wants to create a community for Vue developers, they may be thrown back if one already exists.

Well this is only my very initial impressions, and it's clear that this is only a pilot at the moment focusing on some narrow aspects. It's also possible that my use case is not within their scope and that's also cool. That's what feedback loops are for.
