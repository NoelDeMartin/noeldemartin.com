Hey, I bet you didn't expect to hear from me again this year (I didn't either). But I've got some news to share! I submitted a talk proposal for FOSDEM, and I'm glad to announce that it's been accepted 🥳!

[From Zero to Hero with Solid](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_from_zero_to_hero_with_solid/)

I do admit the title is a bit cheeky, but hey, you've got to create some hype! Also, I couldn't come up with a better name 😅️. But it does communicate pretty well what the talk will be about. I'll share everything I've learned [since I started with Solid](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-task-manager-using-solid) until now. It should be fun :).

So yeah, Umai will **definitely** be released by then.

FOSDEM will be held the 4th & 5th of February in Brussels. I hope to see you there :D.
