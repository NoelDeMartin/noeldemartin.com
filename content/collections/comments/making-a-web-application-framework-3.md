Summer is over (kind of), and I'm back in the saddle.

I did continue working on this during [my stay in Japan](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/working-from-japan), but I wasn't trying to get anything done. And to be honest, that's been my mindset for this task since I started it. But I think it's time to start setting some goals into my sight.

Some of the things I've been doing were productive though. For example, I finally added [Offline First](https://aerogel.js.org/playground/offline) functionality to the framework, and it was easy to extract from [Umai](umai.noeldemartin.com/). Other things I've been doing haven't been so fun; in particular all the jazz with bundling, versioning, and taming Node's dependency hell. There's been a lot of talk about AIs [taking our jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-kgb1QtSnU) as programmers, though I don't think that's happening any time soon. But if anything actually happens, I hope that is AIs taking care of all of this mess. One can only hope.

Anyhow, to wrap up this exploration phase I've prepared a demo that I think encompasses what the framework is all about. If you still weren't sure what the heck I'm trying to do, this should make it clear. And I thought the best way to do the demo was on video. You can find it in my Youtube channel: [Aerogel Sneak Peek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXyCH_S9efk).

The process of making the video was in itself interesting, because it's the first time I do something like this. It's not like I'm going to become a Youtuber or anything, but I always enjoy watching [videos of developers going through code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXaC0YvDgIo&list=PL9wALaIpe0Py6E_oHCgTrD6FvFETwJLlx). So I thought it would be fun to give it a shot myself. I'm not 100% happy with the result, but I also think the point of doing this is to get it done quickly, so it's fine that it turned out a bit rough. If you're curious about the tooling, I used [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for recording the video/camera, and [Olive](https://www.olivevideoeditor.org/) for editing. Honestly, it was a lot easier than I expected. And if I want to improve anything about this in the future, it's more related with my presentation skills than video editing or recording. Special shoutout to [Better Dev Screencasts](https://www.betterdevscreencasts.com/) though. Simon is awesome, and even though I didn't spend almost any time on my setup, it was still useful.

Now that that's done, my next goal will be to start writing real apps using the framework. There are still many things I haven't finished in the framework itself, but it's better to start using it rather than waiting for it to be perfect. And the best place to get started is rewriting [Ramen](https://ramen.noeldemartin.com/). Ideally, the UI will stay the same, because one of my goals with this framework is to empower bespoke UIs. We'll see how that goes!
