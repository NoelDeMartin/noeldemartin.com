The introduction is already awesome. I knew most of what they do, but still, they keep delivering on my expectations. On this note, I'll say (if it wasn't clear already) that I'm a huge fan of Basecamp. Maybe too much, actually.

I've been pondering about my own thinking, and I realized that sometimes I'm of extreme opinions. I either like something a lot or I don't like it. And I don't think extremes are good, so this time I'll try to find something to disagree with. I've been reading their content for a long time, so maybe challenging their assertions will give me a new perspective on their content.
