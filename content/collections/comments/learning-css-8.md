And here we are, one module away from the last!

As I anticipated, this one about animations was great. One of the things I've always aspired to do with my apps is to make them enjoyable and fun. Or as Josh puts it, [more whimsical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2d9rw9RwyE). This module was all about that.

It is one of the modules I've enjoyed the most, but ironically it's also one of the modules where I've learned the least new "features". I was already familiar with mostly everything introduced, but it has been very interesting to learn about Josh's explanations of how and why to use animations. For example, I've always used [timing functions](https://cubic-bezier.com) almost at random (or not at all); but Josh lays down a theory of when to use which and what to consider. I also got some terminology for things I've been doing but didn't have a name for, like Orchestration. And I learned about the importance of [Spring physics](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/a-friendly-introduction-to-spring-physics/) and the [FLIP technique](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/animating-the-unanimatable/) (now I know why [I've heard so much talk](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1628216739921027072) about [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)).

But there is also something bittersweet about this lesson. There was a lot of "this is beyond the scope of this course", specially for the parts I was more interested about. Which is understandable, given that this is a course about CSS and not animations specifically. But that makes me hope, maybe some day we'll be able to see a course of his about animations? That would be awesome!
