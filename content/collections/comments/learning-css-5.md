After almost 3 months, I'm finally done with Module 5: Responsive and Behavioural CSS. I've dedicated the same time as usual (1 hour a week), so I guess that means this module was longer. [The workshop](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/css-for-js-workshop-5) was specially challenging, since it took me like 3 to 4 hours to complete.

The lessons were interesting and touched on a topic I'm very fond of. But this time I was already familiar with most of the concepts, as I've always kept responsiveness in mind. Although something I don't think much about is fluid design. Essentially, responsive means that you have different styles depending on the breakpoints, whilst fluid means that values scale with the size of the viewport. Both have their pros and cons, and Josh gives some compelling arguments to use both as necessary.

This module also introduced CSS variables, which reminded me of something I forgot to mention in previous updates. One way to think about CSS is as a collection of algorithms; the layout algorithms. And you can see properties as the arguments to these algorithms. For example, even though the `width` property has the same name, it can have completely different behaviours on a `display: block` or a `display: flex` element. Using this mental model, CSS variables and all their quirks are a lot easier to understand. You can learn more about that idea in this post: [Understanding Layout Algorithms](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/).

In summary, overall I enjoyed this module as well. But this time, there was something I didn't like: the code stack :/. In module 3, I learned about [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and it was fun to learn something new. But now it's starting to become annoying, since working with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a lot easier (not to mention React vs Vue). It was annoying to the point that completing the workshop felt more like a fight against the tools than learning CSS. Hopefully, it won't be much of an issue for the remainder of the course.
