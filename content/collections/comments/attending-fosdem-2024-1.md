This will be my 4th time attending FOSDEM; I was there in [2019](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem), [2020](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem-2020), and [2023](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem-2023) (2021 and 2022 editions were held online). And I can definitely say I love this conference :D. Last year was also my first time presenting, and the experience was great. I'm in awe at how well the conference is run, given it's magnitude. And the fact that it's run by volunteers is even more impressive.

I actually haven't made much noise online, but I'm also presenting this year. However, it's just [a 5-minute lightning talk about Moodle](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2167-moodle-empowering-educators-to-improve-our-world/), so I didn't think it'd be of interest to most people who already know me. In fact, the point is to make [Moodle](https://moodle.com) known to people who are not familiar with it. In my little bubble I think that everybody already knows it, but my conversations with some attendees over the years showed me otherwise.

As always, I've gone through the schedule to see which talks I'm more keen to attend. And sure enough, many of them are overlapping. At least this will serve me as a reminder to watch the recordings later on. Overall it's looking good, but I do miss the [Decentralized Internet and Privacy devroom](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/decentralized_internet_and_privacy/) and I can't help but notice the absence of anything mentioning the [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org/) :(.

I may also attend some [OFFDEM](https://offdem.net/) sessions, but so far I haven't been able to find a schedule so I'm not sure how that will turn out.
