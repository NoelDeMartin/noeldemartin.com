First day of FOSDEM and second day in Brussels! As I had planned, yesterday I attended the beer event at Deilirum Caf√©. I met some people from the previous year and also some new faces. Something interesting I came across was [aleph.im](https://aleph.im), which as a project aimed to create decentralized applications. Since I prepared [solid-focus](https://github.com/noeldemartin/solid-focus/) to be decoupled from the data storage (using [soukai](https://soukai.js.org/)), I think it should be possible to create an Aleph.im engine. It may be a fun project for the future.

Today I started the day attending the [Selfish Contributor](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/selfish_contributor/) talk, and it was quite interesting. After meeting with some more people I went to the second talk I had planned, but this one I didn't enjoy as much. It was good and I agreed with the message, but too long for the content in my opinion (it could have perfectly been a lightning talk).

I was supposed to attend the third talk in my schedule. But I recently found out about [OFFDEM](https://ps.zoethical.org/t/why-offdem/2867), an alternative event to FOSDEM. In there, I could find some people who are into ActivityPub and I also learned about some other projects. I'll probably go back next year if I'm around and it happens again. Tomorrow some of them will be on the privacy and decentralized internet room, but I also have other talks I'd like to watch and almost none of them is in that room. So let's see how I manage.

I ended up the first day at FOSDEM by attending some lightning talks and a State of the Onion talk about the Tor project.
