I just finished uploading a recording of my talk, you can find it in [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@noeldemartin) (and [PeerTube](https://spectra.video/c/noeldemartin/) ;D).

I would have done it yesterday, but as you may know, we suffered [a massive power outage in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_European_power_outage) ðŸ˜±. It was gone at 12:30am, and in my case I didn't have it back until 2am. The funny thing is that we still don't know what caused it ðŸ˜…. Was it a technical failure? a cyber attack? aliens? Who knows. In any case, it's amazing that something like this can even happen. What's more astonishing to me, having great weather conditions in Spain, is that almost nobody has solar panels nor any other way of generating electricity autonomously. So the grid goes down, and we're back to the stone age. Hopefully this will be a wake up call to change that. Once again, we face the issues of centralization.

In any case, that's enough rambling. Now that I'm done with the recording, this task is complete.
