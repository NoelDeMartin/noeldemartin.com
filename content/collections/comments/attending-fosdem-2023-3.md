Well, as the FOSDEM organizers aptly said, [it's a wrap](https://iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/its-a-trap-pun-its-a-wrap-admiral-ackbar-star-wars-1363199217Z.jpg).

I have to say that this year may have been my best one yet :). Besides giving a talk, I met more people than ever and I enjoyed many of the talks.

One that was interesting was [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) (it turns out the founder is from Barcelona and we have some acquantainces in common!). I haven't been using Figma much; I'm still using Photopea and Inkscape/GIMP for everything I do. And one of the reasons I haven't is their proprietary nature. So I'll be sure to give Penpot a try next time.

Another talk I enjoyed was [Matrix 2.0](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/matrix20/). Excellent presentation, packed with awesome live demos, and Moodle even got a shoutout on the Matrix integration we're working on for the upcoming release. I'm not sure if I'll get to work on that, but I'd like to because I'm very interested in Matrix and all the work they're doing.

Once the conference came to a close, this time I stayed to help with the clean up. And I think I'm going to do that in the upcoming years as well, because it wasn't that much work and you also get to meet some of the volunteers. It'd be nice to volunteer full-time at some point as well, but to be honest I like watching the talks too much so I'm not sure if I'll ever get there.

Unfortunately, the end has been bittersweet because [my go-to sandwich shop](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tonton+garby) was closed :(. But hey, not everything always goes as planned! I'll try again next year.
