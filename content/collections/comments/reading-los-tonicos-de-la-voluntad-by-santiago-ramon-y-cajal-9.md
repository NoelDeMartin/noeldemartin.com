Chapter 9 is focused on teaching. He goes into how important it is for a scientist to teach others and gives different tips on how to do the best for students.

This topic is very interesting to me. I enjoy teaching and I've done it formally in some occasions. I also believe education is one of the most (if not the most) important things in society. When pondering about social problems, I often reach the conclusion that education is the key to solving most of them.

And yet, I don't practice teaching on a regular basis. I [work in the open](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/open-productivity) and I try to share what I do, but that's not really teaching. Sharing is also very important, but it ain't teaching. So why's that? Right now, two reasons come to mind.

The first one that it takes effort. It also takes effort to document my journey like I'm doing now, but preparing educational resources is a different game (I write documentation, but I consider that something else).

The second reason is that I actually don't know _what_ to teach. I feel like anyone can learn most of what I know on their own (although I know that's not 100% true). So I end up reducing the things I would like to teach to philosophical or abstract topics. I guess that's part of the reasons why you won't find technical posts in [my blog](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/), even though I'm a developer and I spent most of my day programming.

If I really think about it, the second reason makes no sense and I should probably teach things that are "obvious" to me anyways. I've actually got some potential posts prepared and it may be time to start thinking about writing those. Regardless of that, I'm sure at some point teaching will become part of my daily work, because I've enjoyed the experiences I've had and I think education is really important. But I'm not quite sure when that'll happen.
