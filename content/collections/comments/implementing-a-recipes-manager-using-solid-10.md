Hey, I'm back!

Actually, I've been back since early September. But I wanted to finish working on the data layer before posting an update. It's been a slog, but I'm finally ready to move on.

I've been working on this app for a long time, and I don't think I'll be done with it before the end of the year. So it's very likely that this task becomes the first one to span multiple years in my development journal. Sure, I've been doing other things here and there, but it's certainly taking a lot longer than I expected. This is not something new though, if you read [the development journal for Media Kraken](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-media-tracker-using-solid), you'll notice a similar pattern. For Media Kraken, it was refactoring Solid and IndexedDB storage into a single API. For this task, it's been implementing [a conflict resolution strategy for Solid](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/request-for-comments-crdtish-approach-to-solid/4211). I worry a lot about [accidental complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet#Summary), and I'm pretty sure I'm prone to over-engineer. But looking back, I'm glad I spent the time doing the refactor in Media Kraken. Only time will tell if the work I just finished was also worth it.

So, keeping that in mind, I've decided to do an alpha release of the app. The app will probably look nothing like it does now when it's finished, but I'm interested in getting feedback about the conflict resolution strategy before releasing for production. If you are interested in giving feedback, read about it in the Solid forum: [Umai `alpha` release feedback](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/request-for-comments-crdtish-approach-to-solid/4211/14).

Now that I'm done with that, I can finally focus on the UI. Before starting the next cycle, I'll do some wireframes and think about what I want to include in the first version. All of this time, I've been having many ideas for the UI and some cool features, so I'll have to make an effort to reduce all of that into something doable in 6 weeks.
