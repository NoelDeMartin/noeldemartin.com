Yes, it's finally happening. My first Solid conference!

This is something I've been looking forward for a long time. I've attended some Solid-adjacent events, like local meetups or [presenting at FOSDEM](https://noeldemartin.com/fosdem). But I have never been to a conference exclusive to Solid (not that there are many that I'm aware of). However, I'm trying to keep my expectations in check because I already [had a bittersweet experience with a Laravel conference](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-laracon-eu).

The main thing I'm looking forward to, honestly, is meeting people. This is not always the case; when I attend FOSDEM I'm very much looking forward to the presentations themselves. But I guess I've been into Solid for so long that I don't think anything will be revealing to me. I'm looking forward to being suprised, though!

Something else I'm excited about, of course, is to present my own talks. I'm actually giving two: one about Developer Experience, and once about CRDTs.

I've always been interested about DX, and I believe it is one of the most important things to get right if we want Solid to ever pick up. I worry that my presentation ended up too specific to my own tooling, but I always mention it in passing so it's nice to finally dedicate a presentation to everything I've been building under the hood. And I'm looking forward to see what people think, because it seems like the approach I'm taking is very much outside of most Solid developers zeitgeist. But I feel like it's the norm for the developer communities I admire when it comes to DX, like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

I'm also very interested in CRDTs and [local-first software](http://inkandswitch.com/local-first/), but that's something more recent that I stumbled upon trying to solve my problems with Solid. In particular, I'm focusing this talk and my work on making it work _in practice_. A lot of the work happening in Solid is very theoretical or experimental, but again, if we ever want Solid to pick up we need to make things that people can use. So I'm excited to share my views on this, and how I solved it in my own apps.

Unfortunately, the presentations are not going to be recorded. So I'll have to miss the ones I can't attend. But fear not, I will record mine after the conference :).
