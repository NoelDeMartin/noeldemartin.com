I recently had to buy a new laptop, and I've been having some issues with it. At first I thought it had something to do with drivers, because it's not unheard of to have issues with [nvidia in linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_36yNWw_07g). But after contacting the ASUS support, it looks like I've got some defective hardware and I'll need to send it back. The lesson to learn here is that I shouldn't assume issues always arise from me using "alternative" operative systems; hardware can be defective too. So yeah, I've wasted a bunch of time configuring a defective laptop and I'll be laptopless for a while. But I expect to continue doing some work at home where I can plug my old laptop to the TV (the screen is broken and I don't have a monitor).

But, I could get some things done! (I wouldn't be writing here if I hadn't). Some time ago, I used a site called [webpagetest.org](https://webpagetest.org) to evaluate how I could improve my website, and I applied some of their suggestions. One thing I did was to refactor the way I'm using fonts. I was using googlefonts, but I wanted to get rid of those so that I don't give Google any of my visitors' information anymore (I don't use Google Analytics, nor any other analytics for that matter). I also removed a lot of glyphs from the font I'm using in the header, since I only need a couple of characters and I was using the whole font. I reduced it from 35kb to 4kb, which may not seem much but every byte counts (I used [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) to do that). I've also been working with nginx, and I've added some new commands to [nginx-agora](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/nginx-agora). I optimized caching static assets using the `expires max;` directive, and I turned off access logs [for visitors privacy](https://ar.al/2018/06/28/are-you-logging-ips-without-even-knowing/).

Finally, I did something I've been pondering for a while. And that is setting up a [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters) account (previously called Google Webmasters). The reasons why I had my doubts are manyfold. I don't want Google to [be everywhere](https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1049726694909726721), so I will do whatever I can to keep my vistors' information safe from them. Search Console doesn't interfere with my visitors, so I may as well see what they have to say about the website. I don't care about SEO in the least, but I care about my website being well-formatted and performant. I already know one of the suggestions they'll give me, to use AMP for my blog posts. And quite frankly, on that one [they can go fuck themselves](https://www.polemicdigital.com/google-amp-go-to-hell/).
