Today I've finished one last iteration where I've updated the home page and reviewed the copy in multiple pages. I have also added a footer and a [new section](https://noeldemartin.com/site), where I explain the technologies I've been using.

I could continue iterating, and I am not 100% happy with some of the current design. But I'll stop this task here because it's dragged long enough. I'll probably continue iterating at some point in the future, but that's it for now.
