After doing some brainstorming, I've decided to focus next cycle on just the basics. Eventually, I would like to add 4 sections in the app: Cookbook (to manage recipes), Kitchen (to cook recipes), Pantry (to keep track of ingredients storage and make shopping lists), and Calendar (for meal planning). But all of that can get out of hand soon, and I'm not sure if I'll include that in the first version (probably not). This is very similar to Media Kraken; I wanted to track other types of media but I ended up only tracking movies (for now).

So here's what I'm focusing on for this cycle:

- **Branding:** I'm still not super happy with the name "Umai", and I haven't made a logo either. So I'll use this cycle to finish those. I can always change them later on, but it's time to settle on what I'll do for the first release.

- **Design System:** I've been using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which already has some constraints, but I'd like to organize the UI even more. So far, I've been a big fan of design systems in theory, but I haven't really used them in practice. So I'm looking forward to experiment with this. I've been playing with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and it's been a bit of a pain to configure with Vite, but I think I've got it sorted out.

- **Panache:** I think one of the main reasons why people like Media Kraken is the animations, and I've had a lot of fun making them. But I always thought I could take it up a notch, and I've seen [a couple](https://pagetransitions.netlify.app) [of ideas](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1186675229621248000) I'd like to play with. But of course, there is also the danger of taking it too far, and I worry about that. I don't want to end up with an app that is annoying to use because everything is moving around. I also don't want to spend too much time working on this. Fun as it is, it's just a nice to have and there is a lot more things I want to do.

I'm starting this cycle next week, and I'm going back to the standard 6-week length. So it should be finished by November 29th.
