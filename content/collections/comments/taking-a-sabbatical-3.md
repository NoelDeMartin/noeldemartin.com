I'm entering the 3rd month of my sabbatical, and I can officially say that I'm growing tired of it ðŸ˜…. I know, I know. A guy complaining that he has too much free time, give me a break. But that isn't the problem. This is the first time I've been living as a "Digital Nomad", and I don't like it :(. It's fine for a couple of weeks, but I've been traveling for almost a month now, and I miss a lot of my routines. That's not to say that I'm not enjoying it as well. But I'm certain that this is not something I'd like to do in the long term... at least not like I'm doing it now.

## Life Stuff

As I mentioned in the last update, we landed on Singapore on September 6th. I'm now writing from Pattaya (Thailand), and we traveled here on land (buses, trains, etc.). Crossing Malaysia, and stopping along the way. So far, we've been to 8 cities. Which isn't a lot compared to other times we've travelled, but our lifestyles have been quite hectic. In fact, the only period I've felt "at home" was the 7 days we spent on an Airbnb in Kuala Lumpur.

Again, I want to emphasize that I'm enjoying the trip (even though you may not feel it from my writing ðŸ˜…). The trouble is that I'm experiencing an overload of stimulus. I miss the quiet times at home, I miss cooking my own meals, and yes, I miss "wasting time" watching TV Shows and movies. One of the most worrying things is that I can see how my health is deteriorating :(. Again, like in [my trip to Japan](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/working-from-japan#comment-3), I'm finding it difficult to find non-animal sources of protein (or healthy options in general). And I haven't been working out nearly as much as I should.

But if I had to pinpoint the root of all evil, that would be my lack of [time affluence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd8NLGBYp3U). Again, [the same as in Japan](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/working-from-japan#comment-4)! Which is totally self-imposed, so I'll have to make an effort to slow down and avoid the temptation to "go out and do things".

Anyways, that's it for my ramblings, sorry that you had to read that.

So, we landed on Singapore. Besides being quite modern and extravagant (maybe some would call it "artificial"?), I really liked the mixture of cultures. Other cities I visited had similar vibes (Barcelona, without going too far), but Singapore really felt like a melting pot of different cultures. Unfortunately, we only spent a single day, so I'm looking forward to going back at some point.

Malaysia surprised me in a couple of ways. I didn't expect most people to speak English (which shows how little I knew about their history). And overall, it was very easy-going. I was also surprised at the number of malls (also in Thailand). We definitely don't have as many in Europe, and I don't remember seeing so many in Taiwan 10 years ago. In some ways, I like malls, for all the obvious reasons. And I love going to the cinema. But I also despise the consumerism and blandness of it all. Unfortunately, we end up going more often than I would like for their convenience and ubiquity. We've also visited a lot of temples, food markets, and other attractions. One of the highlights of the trip has been visiting some [tea plantations in Cameron Highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOH_Plantations) (did you know that tea plants live hundreds of years and are harvested all year long? There are even thousand years old in China :O).

In Thailand, in contrast, cash is king and English skills are more of a rarity. But I also enjoy the quirkyness and novelty of a different culture (though I'm not melding in their daily life as much as I'd like). As expected, there are a lot of TukTuks around (there is even an "[Uber for TukTuks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.muvmi.passenger)!"). And I'm feasting on coconuts and mangoes (again, probably not too healthy ðŸ˜…). We also attended [a cooking class](https://sabiengcooking.com/class/) and learned to make a Sour & Spicy soup, which I'll certainly try to replicate at home (though I'm not sure I'll find the right ingredients).

Finally... [Durians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian). They are everywhere, and despite having travelled to other Asian countries in the past, I almost didn't know of their existence. I'm sorry to say that I don't like them, but people around here seem to love them.

And that's mostly it for the life updates! Here's some pictures from the trip:

There were chickens roaming in the streets of Singapore, which was funny in contrast with the otherwise modern landscape.

We watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049403/" target="_blank">Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</a> in Malaysia's Beanie seats, which was a fun experience (<a href="https://www.sayaiday.com/2014/10/tgv-beanie-movie.html" target="_blank">not my picture</a> though, the ones we made weren't good ðŸ˜…).

## Tech Stuff

This month, I've been pretty consistent spending an hour or two in front on the computer every day. Unfortunately, I don't think I've done a single day of full-time work, so I haven't practiced too much [flow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>) and I miss it tremendously :(. Again, it's mostly self-imposed and I'll have to make an effort to slow down. Now I see what they mean about the dangers of having too much freedom!

Ironically, something that I've been doing a lot is reading. What years of routines and timeboxing didn't accomplish, commuting has. I've spent a lot of time in transit, so I've been catching up with books and articles from my lists.

I've also managed to get some things done. First of all, I finally submitted my [proposal for NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/)! I initially planned to apply for the deadline of December 1st. But after getting some tips from previous grantees (shout-out to [SÃ©bastien](https://framapiaf.org/@srosset) from [ActivityPods](https://activitypods.org/) and Niko from [NextGraph](https://nextgraph.org/)), it seems like it was more sensible to do it now if I plan to start working in January. I submitted 3 proposals, even though I only intend to work on one, because I'm keen to hear what they have to say about the different ideas. They are essentially [the ones I talked about in my blog post](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/the-end-of-the-chapter#the-plan), but more fleshed out.

There's also been some developments in the world of Solid, and I've been [participating in the discussion](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/inrupts-data-wallet/7836) (TLDR; Inrupt released a Wallet Application they claim to be compatible with Solid, but I don't think it has anything to do with Solid and it's actually a proprietary solution). It really is a bummer, and I don't like to be the portent of negativity. That's why I was mostly neutral, if not positive, in [my previous commentary on Inrupt](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/why-solid#inrupt). But this crossed the line, because it was misleading to people who may not be too familiar with Solid (even if not on purpose). So I thought it was important to speak out.

Finally, I also kept tinkering with some things related to Focus. I did [some improvements](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/commit/e6b42ac197141513026b42db1139db2f809f1a0e) here and there, but mostly I've continued playing with Vivant. It's still a proof of concept, and I don't have much to share yet, but I'm very excited about it. I love working with animations/UI, and [Josh Comeau announced he'll be working on an animations course](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog-v2/#aside-svg-animations); so it'll be the perfect excuse to learn more about animations. In particular, I've been trying to recreate [Shared Layout animations](https://www.framer.com/motion/layout-animations/#shared-layout-animations) from Framer Motion, and I've seen how they can become very complicated very quickly. Making these from scratch involves doing some math, but thankfully this is not my [first](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2099.1/23874) [rodeo](https://noeldemartin.com/projects/beastmasters). So yeah, I don't know if this is going to lead anywhere, but it's a ton of fun. I guess that's the perfect thing to be doing in a sabbatical :).
