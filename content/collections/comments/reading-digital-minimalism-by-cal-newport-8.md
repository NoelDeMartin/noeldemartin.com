Chapter 6, this is starting to get a bit repetitive, but there is thankfully only one chapter to go. Again, I agree with the overall philosophy but not the practices he recommends. As someone in the book club pointed out, it's funny that he said how important it's to have a philosophy and not rely on "hacks", and this exactly what these practices are.

For my opinions on this chapter I'll instead say what I usually do myself. The chapter is focused on how to manage leisure and free time, and some of the things he recommends are doing manual activities. I actually tried doing that long ago, when I built a remote controlled car using DC motors, a raspberry pi and handcrafted parts (that's why I made [this](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/DC-Motor-Sandbox)!). And the truth is it was cool but I dedicated too much time for what I got out of it. One of the reasons why he suggests it's important to do that is to be in contact with the physical world and get out of digital screens. But I already do that with other activities such as hiking, sport and cooking.

Something else he mentions is to join groups for doing structured social activities. That is something I actively avoid. I already have enough structure in my life, given that I rely heavily on timeboxing. And my social life is entirely based on meeting with friends and attending cultural or social events. Something that may not be so common in other countries, but I'm glad that happens here (Catalonia, Spain) is that there are many cultural and traditional events. Last week for example was [Carnestoltes](http://www.catalannews.com/life-style/item/carnival-arrives-and-many-catalan-towns-launch-the-largest-street-party-of-the-year), known elsewhere as carnival, and there were a lot of events related to that. Now that he's dead, we have [La Vella Quaresma](https://ca.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vella_Quaresma) and every Sunday there is an event for cutting one of her seven legs until Eastern arrives.

Finally he goes into suggesting to batch low-quality leisure such as social media. I actually have trouble doing _any_ social media at all, and I already plan most of my high-quality leisure activities.
