Hey, I'm back in Barcelona.

I don't have as much to say this time, but I want to mention the contrast with the first part of my trip. As I anticipated, the last 3 weeks were quite hectic. Which is not to say they weren't fun, but I think it's ironic that I felt more time affluence whilst working than on holidays üòÖÔ∏è.

To be fair though, I did visit and experience a lot more things in these 3 weeks; but honestly I'm not sure that means it was better. Specially the last week, which I spent entirely in Tokyo and the days were a bit repetitive. Still, I love Japan, so even that last week was great and I'll miss it.

However, even coming to this realization, I'm not sure if I'll change my habits. In part because it's not just my decision to make (I wasn't traveling alone on this second phase). But also because I'm not sure there is a workaround to "taking things slowly" without resulting in huge economical detriment. Or radically changing my lifestyle. With that I don't mean that I was living a lavish life in Japan; the main finantial issue with prolonging "mini-lives" is that I still have a life to maintain back at home. So I'm essentially paying rent twice (which is a huge privilege to be able to do). And I don't see how to fix that without going full nomad. For now, short mini-lives will have to do.

This time I won't leave you with a list of highlights; instead I'll link to this [list of tips I wrote](/japan-tips) and leave you with some pictures:
