I've read the conclusion and it didn't bring any new points to my attention, so I have nothing to add about the book.

Now, there were a couple other things I wanted to test while reading the book. One of them was to see what it's like to use the Kindle app. My conclusion is that yeah sure, the app works great, but the key features that I used were almost the same as reading PDFs (text highlight & extraction). So I'll continue avoiding buying Amazon ebooks if I can. If only because I don't like having to install their application; I prefer using an open format like PDF.

The other thing that happened while reading this book was participating in the book club! Quite frankly, it was better than the book. It's true that the participation declined a bit over the last weeks, but that's ok. I enjoyed getting different insights, especially things I hadn't thought about. I can sincerely say it upgraded my experience of reading the book.

And one of the highlights were [Bryan Mathers](http://bryanmmathers.com/)' drawings! In each chapter, along with his opinions, he uploaded some doodles he did while reading the book. And I loved them :). Here's one of my favourites:
