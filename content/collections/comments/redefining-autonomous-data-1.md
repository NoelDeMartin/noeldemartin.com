I've updated the readmes in the [Kinko](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/kinko) and [Focus](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/focus) repositories. They were my initial approach to Autonomous Data before learning about Solid. Since I don't think I'll be working on them for a while, I wanted to document the current status and indicate that they are not under development.

I think they are still valuable for research purposes, and this will also be useful if I ever want to start working on them again.
