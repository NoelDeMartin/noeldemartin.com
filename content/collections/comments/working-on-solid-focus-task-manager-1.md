I've published a [new release](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/releases/tag/v0.2.3) with the improvements I wanted to make.

Surprisingly, I didn't need to use my appetite to trim the scope and make trade-offs because I managed to do everything within the estimation, which rarely happens. In terms of time dedication it took me 8 hours to complete what I had initially planned, and then an additional 2 hours for some stretch goals that I was willing to drop if I couldn't get done this week. That's a total of 10 hours which ain't bad for an 8 hours estimation. Of course, the important estimation and appetite here was the real-time limit of two weeks, and that's been honored.

I'm looking forward to continue experimenting with the concept of appetite, specially for my next task which is way more open-ended.
