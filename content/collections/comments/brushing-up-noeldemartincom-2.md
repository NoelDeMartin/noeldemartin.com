As a follow up to yesterday's Shift upgrade, I've been looking at the [upgrade notes](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/upgrade) to see if I didn't miss anything. I think it's a good idea to take a quick look, but I didn't find anything that hadn't been covered by Shift, so all good. Usually, I also watch the [What's New](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-6) lessons on Laracasts, so I'm pretty much covered on all sides. Of course, I don't think all of this is necessary in order to upgrade, Shift should suffice, but I also enjoy learning what's going on in Laravel to keep up to date with new features.

I've also been talking with [Jason McCreary](https://twitter.com/gonedark), the creator of Laravel Shift, and given him some feedback on the service. He's been very helpful on solving some of my doubts and he's still working on improving Shift, so I'm sure it'll become even better. One of the things I learned from him is about the [Shift configuration file](https://laravelshift.com/shiftrc-configuration-file). This is a file you can have in your repo to configure how Shift behaves, and it can be very helpful to customize some of the automation.

With this, I consider my upgrade with Shift complete. Now I'll try something else I'm very excited about: [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com).
