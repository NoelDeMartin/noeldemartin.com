Today I finished the first version that stores tasks in a Solid POD (including a hierarchy of lists and workspaces). The code for this project can be found on this github repo: [github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus).

I still have many things to complete before I can consider this MVP "done". For example, making more efficient requests (I didn't succeed on querying with SPARQL yet), validating my use of Solid standards with community members, adding more RDF attributes, etc.
