And that's it, I've officially spoken at FOSDEM ðŸ¥³!

The talk went well, and I think people enjoyed it :). There were a couple of interesting questions as well. If you missed it or want to dig deeper, you can find both the slides and the video recording in [the event page](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_from_zero_to_hero_with_solid/).

It was also nice meeting in person with some people I knew from the Solid forums and chats. And hopefully I've inspired someone in the audience to give Solid a try. Or if nothing else, to make better apps!

Tonight I'll probably be at [HSBXL's Bytenight](https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/bytenight/), and I'm looking forward to tomorrow's talks (specially the ones in the [Open Source Design](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/open_source_design/) devroom). Yesterday I ended up going to both the [OFFDEM launch party](https://ps.zoethical.org/t/launch-party-at-caldarium/6428) and the "unofficial" Beer Event (it was packed with people anyways, so I ended up in [Toone Theatre](http://www.toone.be/spip.php?page=sommaire&lang=en) which was a lot less crowded and quite nice).
