Ok, so the cycle finished yesterday and this is where things stand:

![Hill Chart 29th June 2024](/img/tasks/hillchart-2024-06-29.png)

As always, I haven't finished everything; but I can say I am mostly done with UI! There are still a couple of screens I have to tweak, but it's mostly a chore at this point. I would consider the branding and style of the app completed. Furthermore, I've also implemented a couple of new features that weren't available in the old version of the app, such as global search and custom workspace colors.

So, what is left, and what are the next steps?

Even though most of the main work is done, I still have to work on some edge-cases. For example, in [Umai](https://umai.noeldemartin.com) I let users choose where they want to store their recipes, and I wanted to do the same in Focus. But it's more tricky, because each workspace and list is a separate container. This also complicates the synchronization, I haven't completely finished the _secret landing page_, and I haven't even started looking at migrating data from the legacy app ðŸ˜±. Finally, I also have some [important news](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=459794#p1846521:~:text=Warm%20thanks%3A,your%20next%20adventure!%20%F0%9F%98%98) I'll talk about next month that will probably have an impact on this task.

With all that, I've realized the release is farther away than I thought... So I'll do something in between. Similar to what I did with the [Umai Beta](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/umai/issues/1), I'll release a beta of the new version for early feedback and testing. But this time, I think I'll be more aggresive on the "beta" thing, and I don't think I'll call it "production ready" as I did for Umai. Still, I'll probably use it for production myself, but I won't recommend it.

And that about covers my plans for the next month. You should hear from me again by the end of July / early August, and I'm very excited to finally share what I've been working on in 2024 :).
