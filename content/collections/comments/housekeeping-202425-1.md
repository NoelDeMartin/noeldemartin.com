Well, hello 2025!

After spending a couple of weeks back home, I'm ready to "go back to work". Whatever that means in my situation! So far, I've been mostly in holiday mode. But the holiday mode I seem to enjoy the most, which is not moving around too much and going out sporadically. Tons of time affluence :D.

One of the main things I've done, of course, is my New Year Resolutions for 2025. I do them every year, and even though I know they are not sacred, they are very helpful to keep me on the right track. This year's themes have been mostly the same as always: improve my health, learn Japanese, etc. But there are two important additions. One of them is obvious, sorting out what to do with my life (career-wise). And the other one is to [Try Hard](https://aaronfrancis.com/2024/what-if-you-tried-hard-dac139a5).

I was inspired to do this by reading [Aaron Francis' 2024 restrospective](https://aaronfrancis.com/2024/year-in-review-2024-ebfbb78c). I've always had an aversion to the idea of "working hard", because I equate it with "working a lot of hours". I'd much prefer to work smart in 8 hours/day, 5 days/week. But reading Aaron's writing, I realized there's another way to look at that. Working hard can also mean to take risks, to be ambitious. And I can't say I've done a lot of that (even though I've [quit my job](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/the-end-of-the-chapter) [twice](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/10-years-as-a-software-developer#2014-entrepreneurship) to try and make a living on my own...). What I've failed to do, in my opinion, is iterate fast enough. The problem is that [I enjoy programming too much](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/the-curse-of-being-a-developer), and I can spend weeks or even months coding away and feeling productive. But if I want to succeed, I need three changes in mindset: iterate faster (setting more ambitious deadlines), measuring more (doing user research, tracking how a project is doing after launch), and doing marketing (sharing my projects outside my bubble, making landing pages, thinking about SEO and distribution, etc). The last one will probably be the most challenging. We'll see if I manage!

Other than that, I also fixed a bunch of bugs on [Umai](https://umai.noeldemartin.com/) and [Media Kraken](https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/), I investigated [an issue with CSS 7.1.3](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/issues/1972), I started using my own recipe in [Ramen](https://ramen.noeldemartin.com/), and even released a whole new feature for Umai: Cook Mode! This one is important, because eventually that's what I'd like my work to be like. I've spent a lot of time building tools, and tinkering with Solid's idiosyncrasies. But in reality, what I want to do is build apps and experiences. It was nice to see that I was able to implement a whole new feature (that wasn't trivial) in a couple of days! Though I realize that if I'm going to focus on [Aerogel](https://aerogel.js.org/), I won't do a lot of that in a while ðŸ˜…. But that's still my end goal.

Talking about Aeorgel, as [I mentioned recently](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/taking-a-sabbatical#comment-7), I still haven't got a response for my [NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/) application for funding. But I did get an update, and they told me I'll have to wait until January or early February to know if I've passed the first round (and there are two rounds) :/. I applied in October, so that means if I end up getting the grant it'll happen _at least_ 5 months after my submission ðŸ˜±. I understand they are busy and whatnot, but honestly, that doesn't look good... I've been unemployed for 3 months, and even though I still have some savings, I'm starting to reconsider if this full-time Solid thing was a good idea. My intention was to have an answer by now, and if I did get the grant, test the waters for a year and see how it goes. But I don't think it's viable to make a living off my Solid projects without some initial help. So, much to my chagrin, I'm going to start exploring other options :(. On that note, if you know about some company or job openings where I could fit, please let me know. Also, it'll be interesting to see how to job hunt in this AI-powered environment. I've long known that [the best jobs are not to be found on job boards](https://x.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1796552524889260287). And now, that may be more true than ever.

And that's mostly it for today's update! But I'm not done with the task, because I still have one important thing to do: [Upgrade my Mastodon server](https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/113597653731736608) ðŸ˜±.
