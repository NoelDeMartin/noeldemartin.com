Today I fixed a bug and set up some tests using my favorite CD/CI tool: [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/). I had seen they'd released a new version of their platform and was excited to try it out... Until I found out the new version only works installing a CLI :/.

Unfortunatelly, that's a no go for me. I'll continue using the old version for a while and let's see where it goes. It isn't that I can't install anything, it's just that I don't want any intrusive code running in my machine when the old version is working perfectly fine (actually they only need to access github, so I'm not sure why this new requirement...).
