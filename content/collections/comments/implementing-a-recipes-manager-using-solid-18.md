Just in the nick of time, here it is, the beta release! I've also started using the app myself, so you can finally see what I've been working on for the last couple of years. Sorry for the wait üòù.

It is, however, not ready for release. So I would refrain from sharing it with others. You can learn more about the beta and give some feedback in GitHub: [Beta Feedback](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/umai/issues/1).

I'm sure you've heard this idea that if you're not embarrassed by something you release, you're launching too late. Believe it or not, I've kept this in mind the entire time. So yes, I'm still embarrassed to some extent, but I'm very happy with the way it turned out. We'll see how it goes with the daily usage, and the feedback I get from others.

However, there is something I'm _really_ embarrassed about, and that's animations. What I thought would become an awesome system to implement cool transitions effortlessly, has turned into a bloated collection of hand-coded animations that is high-maintenance, error-prone, and sort of clunky to the eye. When it comes to the UI, the transitions system I cooked up has caused the most headaches by far, and I'm not happy with the way it turned out. The end result from a user perspective is not bad (although I wouldn't be surprised if it's broken in some edge case I didn't test properly), but the developer experience is awful. I still think the fundamentals of my approach are right, and I certainly learned a lot. But I'm not sure if I'm willing to dedicate the time to take this where I'd like it to be. For now it is good enough, but I'll have to think hard and long about upcoming apps and features.

Having said that, I'm really looking forward to the actual release and I don't plan on doing any big changes to the current version. It will also depend on how my daily usage goes, and the feedback I get, but my intention is to release the app as it is now from a user perspective.

I'll be going on holidays for some days in August, and taking more breaks than usual the rest of the month, so I probably won't make any substantial progress until September. And to be honest, I'd be surprised if I have the release out before October. But, hey, you can already use the app! If you want to follow the progress, you can subscribe to the issue on GitHub where I'll be posting about any new beta releases. Hopefully, the next entry on this journal will be about the release and I'll finally close this behemoth of a task.

Thanks for following along!
