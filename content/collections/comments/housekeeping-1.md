I've been looking into my backlog and of course, I have more things than I'll ever be able to do (and it'll keep growing). But that's fine :) I like that idea, nothing is ever really finished. So I'm not getting bored anytime soon. I pulled a couple of things that I want to do before embarking into a new project, and I'll be focusing on those for a couple of months.

I always struggle to write. Meaning that I have to dedicate too much time, and I have other priorities. But I still think it's very important, and I want to continue honing my writing skills. This week I published [a new blog post](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/you-cant-always-get-what-you-want) and I experimented a little with it. In particular, I didn't use "I" even once. I use it to much, and I think it's becoming a crutch in my writing. I won't continue this trend, but it was a good exercise. I also don't put writing this journal entries in the same category as writing blog posts. Here, it's fine to use "I" more often and I don't dedicate as much time either.

I also [implemented the search page](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/pull/363) for the new documentation coming with Vue 3. This is useful for services redirecting to search results using a url, for example [DuckDuckGo's bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang). Right now, if you search `lifecycle hooks !vue` in DuckDuckGo, it'll take you directly to the search results in the Vue docs. That's very useful, and in fact I was the one who implemented the search page and submitted the `!vue` bang to DuckDuckGo for the v2 docs. I also want to do the same for Cypress and I'll probably contribute the search page to VuePress, given that v3 docs are built with that.

Finally, I also decided on what to do with my holidays so I'll be out until August 24th. I'll still be available, but much less responsive (limited to replying emails/socials). For anyone interested, I'm going to do part of the [Camino de Santiago, Northern Way](https://caminoways.com/ways/northern-way-camino-del-norte).
