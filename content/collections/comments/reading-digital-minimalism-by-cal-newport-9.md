I just finished reading the last chapter of the book and the constant has continued. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed, the ideas and mental framework were great, but the specifics on how to achieve it are too biased and narrow. Which is not to say that I wouldn't recommend it, but I think it's better to read a summary first and go into the book only if you want to get more details.

There are two things that make me say this. The first one is that I'm already quite minimalist in my digital interactions, so most of the practices were different ways to achieve something I already do with my current workflow. And the second is that it seems like most practices are a remedy to overcome lack of willpower. For example this last chapter suggests trading your smartphone for a dumbphone in order to avoid the temptation of using social media. I believe discipline and intent are a better way to achieve it. Although I have to agree that for some people (maybe the majority) this has better chances of working.

I said in one of my early comments that I'd take this as informative for society overall, not only from my point of view. But that's something I wasn't able to do in the second part of the book, which is full of practices and things directed at the reader to take action.

I still have to read the conclusion so I'll be back for one last comment before completing this task, but my conclusion is that this book isn't for me.
