Well, that went a lot better than I imagined!

I had reserved today and tomorrow in my calendar to get this done, and you can imagine my surprise when I did it in 15 minutes. Sure, backing up all my files and restoring everything wasn't so fast, but the delicate part of the process went without a hitch. I just followed [the instructions](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/shamu/install), and everything worked flawlessly.

But since we're here and I've decided to talk about this, I thought it would be nice if I mention ALL the apps I've installed from scratch. This turned out a lot longer than I anticipated, so feel free to skim through it:

<details>

<summary class="cursor-pointer">Apps installed</summary>
  
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/">Aurora Store</a>. It would have been nice to install everything from F-Droid, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m able to go 100% Open Source yet (or maybe never). So I searched for decent Open Source solutions first, and fell back to proprietary solutions when necessary. I have to say though, the discoverability in F-Droid is pretty awful. For one, apps have no reviews or anything to gauge their quality, so I had to look at their websites to get an idea. And the search functionality is very lackluster, so I ended up searching more on the web that on the appstore.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.duckduckgo.mobile.android/">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser">Brave</a>. I was already using DuckDuckGo as my primary browser before, but I need an alternative given that it doesn&#39;t support installing PWAs. I was using Google Chrome for this purpose, but this time I decided to go with Brave. It&#39;s actually my first time using it, because I use Firefox on Desktop. We&#39;ll see how it goes.</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about browsers, I love PWAs and I installed a bunch of them. I always prefer them to native apps except in some very specfic scenarios, but not all apps have a PWA counterpart. The ones I have installed now are Twitter, <a target="_blank" href="noeldemartin.social/">Mastodon</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://noeldemartin.github.io/solid-focus/">Solid Focus</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/">Media Kraken</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://settleup.app/">SettleUp</a>, and Google Maps. The only one I&#39;m not happy with is SettleUp (besides my own apps of course, which still need many improvements :P). I was using SettleUp&#39;s native version before, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work well without Google Services, so I&#39;m forced to use the PWA now which is very inferior. I wasn&#39;t super happy with it to begin with. The UX is quite good but the data practices aren&#39;t, so I can&#39;t trust them for the long term.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict">Podcast Addict</a>. I love this app, and I use it all the time (I logged 48 days and 4 hours of listening time since 2017, you do the math). I haven&#39;t tried many other podcasting apps, so I don&#39;t have much to compare with, but I&#39;m so happy with it that I don&#39;t want to bother. It&#39;s also made by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/xguillem">an independent developer</a>, which is always a bonus for me. However, I just found out that the paying mechanism to remove ads only works with Google Services :(. The truth is that ads aren&#39;t too annoying in this app, but still, I hate ads. So I&#39;m torn on this one... I reached out to the developer to see if there is a workaround, but if there isn&#39;t I&#39;ll really struggle to find an alternative.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync">DropSync</a> + <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=md.obsidian">Obsidian</a>. Much like Derek Sivers <a target="_blank" href="https://sive.rs/plaintext">mentioned recently</a>, I&#39;m a big fan of plain text files. In Desktop, I always use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for writing, and it&#39;s probably the thing I do the most on my computer (other than programming). But in Mobile, it&#39;s been a struggle. Plain text files truly are portable and resilient, but I&#39;ve struggled to find editors and sync mechanisms that work for me. Some years ago I was happy using an app called JotterPad, but <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1371121689820602378">that didn&#39;t end well</a>. Since that happened, I haven&#39;t been able to recover my workflow and I&#39;ve dabbling with apps like <a target="_blank" href="https://hyperdraft.rosano.ca/">Hyperdraft</a>, which I like, but are not as good as plain text files. Hopefully, this will be a better approach until I find something definitive.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>. This is the only chat app I&#39;ve had on my phone for a while. I used WhatsApp a lot before, but I &quot;successfully&quot; quit some months ago. I say &quot;successfully&quot; because I haven&#39;t used it again but <a target="_blank" href="https://noeldemartin.social/@noeldemartin/107183411624558172">I&#39;ve felt the consequences</a>. I would use Signal, but it was hard enough convincing some people to install Telegram just to talk with me. I&#39;m not fighting that battle again for a while.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a>. I was using <a target="_blank" href="https://vancedapp.com/">Youtube Vanced</a> before, but this one seems better. One drawback I can see is that it doesn&#39;t allow to log in with a Google account, so I won&#39;t be able to share watch later lists. But I don&#39;t use Youtube on mobile that much anyways, so maybe I won&#39;t mind.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basecamp.hey">HEY</a>. Not much to mention here, I have a HEY email account so this is my email client. Before having a HEY email, I was using <a target="_blank" href="https://k9mail.app/">K-9 Mail</a> and I was quite happy with it.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP">andOTP</a>. The same app I&#39;m using in the tablet for 2FA, which made it easy to transfer codes.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.lesspass.android/">LessPass</a>. My main password manager. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1362479762841739265">LastPass</a> before, but last year <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/NoelDeMartin/status/1362479762841739265">I made the switch</a> and so far so good. I would be lying if I said using this isn&#39;t a little bit more cumbersome, but I think it&#39;s bearable and some day I may try to improve it (thanks to the magic of Open Source :D).</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.example.barcodescanner/">QR &amp; Barcode Scanner</a>. Again, not much to mention here.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.caixabank.caixabanksign">CaixaBank Sign</a>. My bank account&#39;s signing app, which I&#39;m forced to use (thank god it doesn&#39;t require Google Services). I&#39;m also very unhappy with this one, but changing banks is something I&#39;ve had on my TODO list for a while; and I haven&#39;t found any clear alternatives either.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.hm.health">Mi Fit</a>. Again, another app I don&#39;t like having on my phone :/. But it&#39;s the only one compatible with my scale, which I use once a week. I&#39;ll have to replace it one of these days, but going back to my frugal mindset, this one is doing the job.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xodo.pdf.reader">Xodo PDF Reader</a>. This is also one of the apps I use the most in my phone. And for this category, I&#39;ve tried many. Taking advantage of the fresh install, I gave some of the apps in F-Droid another chance, but none came even close. So I&#39;m sticking with it.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly">Feedly</a>. This is the one app I&#39;m the most annoyed with. I also use it quite often, but this is something that should work perfectly in a browser. Alas, it doesn&#39;t; the responsive layout is all messed up. So I&#39;m forced to install the app. This is also a service I&#39;m not 100% happy with, so I&#39;ll have to switch some day.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings">Zoom</a>. Essential for remote work, as you can imagine.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/">DAVx<sup>5</sup></a>. Google Calendar is yet another of those services I want to move away from, but I haven&#39;t done it yet (although the guys at Basecamp <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rework.fm/build-half-a-product-not-a-half-assed-project/">seem to have it on their radar</a> ðŸ¤ž). However, I found a way to synchronize events with the built-in calendar from LineageOS using this app. For now, this should do.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera">Open Camera</a>. I don&#39;t use the camera too much, but I use it sometimes and the one that came with LineageOS wasn&#39;t too good. There is still something missing from this one though, and that is doing 360 photos. I don&#39;t usually take those, but sometimes when I go hiking I find some spots where I can&#39;t help it. And I know when the time comes, I won&#39;t have the inclination to fiddle with appstores and such. So I&#39;ll have to find a decent alternative soon, but so far I haven&#39;t found any. The app I was using before was Google Camera, but I couldn&#39;t find a way to install it in LineageOS.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd</a>. I&#39;m very skeptic about this one, because Google Maps is so good. In particular, not only is it good, but it has a ton of user-contributed information that is very useful. Still, for simple navigation and maps I should be able to move away from Google, so I&#39;ll give this one a try and fall back to using the Google Maps PWA when necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

I realize there is a lot of bickering in that list, and I intend to eventually improve the situation. Actually, I have already started. But changing your digital habits is not something that happens in a day; or even a year. In fact, [finding an ideal environment may be ultimately undesirable](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2022/01/07/new-tools/). But I'm still far from that ideal, and I'm enjoying the path I started walking some years ago. I've been thinking about this for a while, and I think some day I should capture all of this in a blog post. But for now, that's it for this task.

Before I'm done, though, there is one last thing I want to say. It does feel like I have a new phone. It's much faster, and even though I've installed a lot of apps, it feels like I have a lot more room to breathe. This should extend its lifespan for at least a couple more years :).
