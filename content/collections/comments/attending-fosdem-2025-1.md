I'm not giving any talks this year, but it seems like many people I know are attending so it should be fun! It's also the 25th anniversary, and my fifth time attending.

As always, I'm not completely sure what I'll be doing; other than attending some talks, roaming the ULB campus, and eating mini-waffles. But there's a couple of things I'll do for sure. For example, it seems like this year we'll finally have [a proper Solid meetup](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/anyone-attending-fosdem-lets-meet-to-talk-about-solid/1143/25). There are also a couple of talks I'm very excited about, and I'd be remiss if I don't at least pass through the [Open Source Design](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/design/) devroom.

Something I'm not very good at, though, is speaking with people I don't already know :/. It's a common saying that "the hallway track" is one of the highlights of the conference. But I can't say I've experienced much of it... Sure, I go through the stands, and ask a question or two. But I don't really interact with many new people in the conference. I've met some people at fringe events like [the beer event](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/beerevent/), [OFFDEM](https://offdem.net/), or [Bytenight](https://bytenight.brussels/). But I can't say I've actually met anyone _at_ the conference. I guess I simply [suck at notworking](https://rss.com/podcasts/focaterra/1599390/) ðŸ¤·.

In any case, it should be fun either way! Honestly, it's just fun for me to be there and watch the talks :D. Here's a tentative schedule of things I may attend:

Maybe I went a bit overboard this year with the bookmarks ðŸ˜…. Well, in any case, this list will also serve me to watch recordings of the talks I miss :).

It would be fun to meet someone who actually reads this journal, so if you do come say hi!
