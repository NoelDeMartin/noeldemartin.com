Last week was the end of the first round of testing, which I was part of. After having visited the platform about once a day for three weeks, these are my opinions at the moment.

Most of my days consisted on opening the website, checking to see if there was any new community or collection that got my attention, and review some of the discussions I had participated in to see if there was any new activity.

Sometimes I also added resources. But I didn't do too much of that for different reasons. First, what I mentioned about having to create a community was a barrier. Second, I did not see much activity or feedback on my resources, so I didn't feel encouraged to continue doing it. And third, I don't think most of the people taking part in the pilot were interested in these kind of resources. Which is of course to be expected, because we were only 100 participants and the target audience for MoodleNet is educators, not developers.

One of my key takeaways as part of the feedback has been that the success of using the platform depends a lot on what other people is there. Again, not a surprise given that MoodleNet is a Social Network.

And what about new features? I believe that most features are bells and whistles, and the important thing when building software is the core value proposition and how it's serving the user. I think they are doing a good job at that, so I didn't submit many suggestions for new features on [changemap](https://changemap.co/moodle/moodlenet). Another reason is that I waited on my initial reactions to let them sink, and I was glad to see that most of them were already submitted by someone else or fixed by the MoodleNet team with product updates.
