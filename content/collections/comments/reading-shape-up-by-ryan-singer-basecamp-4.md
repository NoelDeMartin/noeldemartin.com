Part 2 was short but to the point.

After learning more about their process, I can see the value of "not having a backlog". But I write it in quotes because it seems to me like they do have a backlog, it's just that they don't call it such. What I mentioned about going extreme with backlog grooming is what they do when they talk about bringing pitches to the betting table. When a pitch is not picked to be completed in a cycle, there is some record of the pitch that can be brought forward for another cycle. And they also track bugs, so I'd consider those things together to be a backlog. But something that is different which I like is that this is a distributed backlog. Each person in the company can keep track of whatever they believe to be important, and pitches can be brought to the betting table by anyone.

What is not completely clear to me is how they choose what to shape, and how they assign people to do it.

Something I didn't agree with at first is a couple of sentences where they mention that some bugs may not be fixed if not many customers complain about. I didn't agree because it seemed to me as discrimination. The fact that a few customers have it doesn't mean it isn't important for them. But after some reflection, I realized they are just being honest with themselves. Because nobody fixes all the bugs, myself included. So it's important to be aware of that and do the best given the reality. Without losing focus on judging bugs on multiple perspectives and not just "popularity".

If there's something I'd want to disagree with on this part, that would be the long-term. They mention repeatedly how they reset the planning every cycle and how they like to keep a clean slate. I can't help but wonder what happens with the company vision, mission and all that. Sure those sound like bullshit at times, but I think a company should have a goal and a purpose, something to achieve. And maybe I'm just saying that from the point of view of an entrepreneur, someone who likes to start things and search for solutions. If they've already achieved whatever they wanted, that's great, but I don't think this can be applied for a start-up or companies still validating hypotheses.

But again, this book is supposed to be about how to build things, not what to build. So it makes sense it won't apply to everyone.
