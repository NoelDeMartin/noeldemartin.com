Well, it is time. I finished part 6 so I'll now start reading the last one: Book VII - The Perfect Light.

I'll surely miss reading Musashi. Some people don't enjoy long stories, but I'm quite the opposite. Once I become familiar with the characters, as long as it maintains its quality, I wouldn't mind it running forever.

Of course, it's very difficult to maintain quality for long before it starts degrading. That's why I believe authors should end on their own terms, instead of dragging it. And there's no denying the value of a good ending.

Looking forward to the climax!
