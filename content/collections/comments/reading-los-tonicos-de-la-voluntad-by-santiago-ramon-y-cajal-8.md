I did not think chapter 8 would be too interesting given the title, "writing of the scientific work", but it proved to be interesting as well. He breaks down some tips into eight categories that I'll refrain from repeating (I'm also not sure how well I'm faring in this translation from Spanish).

One of the things he talks about is having something to say and not just writing for the sake of writing. I have to agree with him, specially comparing it with the software industry. I am kind of disappointed in how many useless things the industry produces, and I think efforts could be focused in solving better problems. Instead we're reinventing the wheel all the time.

Another topic he tackles is diplomacy and respect for other's work, even when criticizing. He also notes the importance to acknowledge previous work and present the assumptions one's work is built upon by citing related works in the bibliography.

Finally he goes into exposing the intricacies of the work done, what I would translate to my field as the classic sentence "show me the code". There is value in abstractions, conclusions and all kind of explanations. But in the end, nothing beats looking at the lowest levels of abstraction to really understand something. He also makes emphasis in simplicity.
