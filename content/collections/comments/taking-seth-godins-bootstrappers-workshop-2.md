Lesson 8 completed. This one was focused on which assets I'm creating with my work that I can leverage later.

I realized it isn't as straightforward as one may think, because there are many assets that end up being useless and some things we regard as unimportant can end up yielding the best results.

So yeah I'm not sure of that, but at least I know this [Open Productivity](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/open-productivity) approach is an asset that I'm building. I did this kind of reflections before, but I wasn't posting them anywhere, so they were "lost" in a sense.

Now you can read this and it can be useful for someone else :D.
