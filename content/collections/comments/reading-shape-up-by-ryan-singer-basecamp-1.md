I've already tracked the progress on reading some books in my website before: [Musashi](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-musashi-by-eiji-yoshikawa), [Los TÃ³nicos De La Voluntad](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-los-tonicos-de-la-voluntad-by-santiago-ramon-y-cajal) and [Digital Minimalism](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport). But the truth is that after those I didn't think I'd do it anymore.

I've realized one of the reasons why I don't read as many books as I'd like to is friction, and I end up reading blog posts instead. This friction comes in many forms: [Having to read a non-digital book](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/reading-los-tonicos-de-la-voluntad-by-santiago-ramon-y-cajal), having to journal about it, having to take notes, having to read all of it, having to read it linearly, etc. Most of those are self-imposed, so I'll try a different approach. I've also been inspired to do this by listening to others' habits like [Naval Ravikant](https://fs.blog/naval-ravikant/) and [Doug Belshaw](https://www.patreon.com/posts/microcast-066-28270885). In fact, I already started reading Emotional Intelligence by Dale Goleman without keeping track here (I even skipped some chapters!).

But that doesn't mean I don't see the value in journaling and all the things I mentioned. And that's why, for some books, I'll do it.

This is one of those books.
