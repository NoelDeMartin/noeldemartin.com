[MoodleNet](https://moodle.net) is a federated social media platform for educators built by [Moodle](https://moodle.com).

Back in 2020, [I hosted my own instance](/tasks/configuring-a-moodlenet-instance) at <code>https://learn.noeldemartin.social</code> to play around with it. It was my intention to host it for a while, and maybe even end up being the home for my educational resources.

However, most of my interest in MoodleNet lay in the fact that it used [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), a protocol that powers other decentralized social media platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) or [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/). But in 2021, [MoodleNet moved away from ActivityPub](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=422885), so I lost interest in using it any further.

Currently, I don't have any intention to host a new instance or anything else for this purpose. But I'm writing this down in case you stumble upon the dead link and wonder what happened with it.

Now you know :).
