Wait, do I have a podcast!?

Actually, no ðŸ˜…. I just generated and episode once using [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/), and I decided to go through all the trouble of setting up [a feed](/podcast/feed.xml) to see how hard could it be. Turns out, it wasn't too hard!

But that was about it. For the time being, I don't have plans to start a podcast. But if you think I should, or you want me to appear on your podcast, <a href="mailto:{{contact.email}}?subject=Podcast">let me know</a>.
