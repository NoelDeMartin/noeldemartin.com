## My values

Values are abstract concepts, and sometimes they are perceived as buzzwords. But values are important to me and I try to embed them in my actions.

These are my values:

- Autonomy
- Awareness
- Continuous improvement
- Creativity
- Education
- Joy
- Openness
- Privacy
- Quality > Quantity
- Simplicity > Complexity
- Sustainability
- Work-life balance

## My background

I have been working in the software industry since 2011. I enjoy programming in and of itself, but I've always cared about the impact of my code. That's what led me to **entrepreneurship**, and I was involved in startups and bootstrapped projects for a while. In 2019 I migrated into **mission-driven organizations**, but now [I'm thinking of doing entrepreneurship again](/blog/the-end-of-the-chapter#here-we-go-again).

I don't like talking about skills, because I think that experience and first principles are what's really important. But skills have an impact on our daily lives and shape our way of thinking, so they are worth mentioning. I've worked as a **fullstack developer** for mobile and web applications, and I love interacting with UI and UX designers. My frameworks of choice are **[Laravel](https://laravel.com){:target="_blank"}** for the backend and **[Vue](https://vuejs.org){:target="_blank"}** for the frontend (although I don't do much backend these days because [I'm building Solid Apps](/fosdem){:target="_blank"}. For mobile I prefer building PWAs or hybrid apps. Whenever possible, I rely on The Web and open technologies.

If you want to know more, some years ago I wrote a summary of my career in my blog: [10 Years as a Software Developer](/blog/10-years-as-a-software-developer).

Or, if you prefer, you can just read [my CV](/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Beyond the code

This website and my online persona are mostly about my career and professional life. But maybe you'd like to see a little bit behind the curtain.

I am an avid Manga reader and I occasionally watch Anime as well. I also watch Movies and TV Shows often, but I cannot say that I have a favorite genre. Music is a big part of my life, and I listen to styles ranging from Death Metal all the way to Folk.

I also enjoy cooking (and eating, of course!). I specially like spicy food and craft beer, and I recently started growing plants at home. Eventually it would be nice to have a small vegetable garden, but for now I'm just learning to keep plants alive.

On occasion I like going for a hike, and I love traveling and learning about other cultures. You may like to know that my two favorite novels are [The Sherlock Holmes Anthology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Sherlock_Holmes){:target="_blank"} and [Musashi](/blog/lessons-learned-musashi-by-eiji-yoshikawa). I enjoy many art forms, and I have more content pending to consume than I'll be able in my life-time. Which makes for a very fun ride :).
