This website is built with [Statamic](https://statamic.com), a CMS powered by [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and PHP. It's the perfect blend between managing content easily, and having the full power of a development framework to implement anything. And they have a generous free tier for single-user websites such as this one. I strongly recommend it!

The frontend is built with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev), using [Turbo Drive](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) for snappier navigation.

You can see [the source code in GitHub](https://github.com/noeldemartin/noeldemartin.com), and most of the content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Feel free to dig around, and if you see any typo I'd appreciate it if you open a PR!

Finally, this is currently hosted on [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) in the Helsinki region, using Docker and [nginx-agora](https://github.com/noelDeMartin/nginx-agora).
