There is a feeling I enjoy a lot. The feeling of Starting Something New.

This is my first blog post, and because of my personality the first thing I did to prepare it was reading the first posts of blogs I follow. It didn't help too much, so I did a list of what I should include here and that's it, I started writing. It wasn't so painful as I thought it'd be.

## Who Am I

I don't really know if anyone who doesn't already know me will even read this, but well in case that happens here you have what you can also read in the [about](/about) section at the moment.

As of my current situation, I recently quit my job (3 months ago) and I'm now trying to follow my dreams and passions. It's not as easy as it sounds, because for starters I don't even know what those are, but as they say “You don’t have to get it right, you just have to get it going”.

By the way, I already started something, and that's [Lincoln's Chilli](http://www.lincolnschilli.com). Check it out, I call it my “entreprenurial sandbox”, and I want to someday convert it into a profitable company.

## What this blog will be about

I have been thinking about writing a blog for a while. I would say as much as 4 years (more or less when I finished university and started reading some blogs). In all this time I have been taking note of ideas I had, but I never actually started a blog (you know, we're all too busy and that kind of excuses). But now there are no more excuses, so here it goes: Noel De Martin's Blog.

They say blogs should be focused in one topic, and I half agree with that. On the one hand, that's how a blog would get readers and create an audience, which gives the blog a reason to be. On the other hand, I don't really know if that'll happen even if I try, and the main focus for now is to write all this ideas I have floating in my head.

Happily for me, there is a way to fulfill both aspects of that. Because of my current situation, my passions and what I'd like to write about, I have realized everything can be summarized in one topic: Developer Entrepreneurship. Being myself a developer who is trying to become an entrepreneur (so I guess right now I am a wantrepreneur), this can be the perfect place to narrate my journey and the ideas I have during this evolution. I am particularly interested in this topic, because I think it is not covered as much as I would like. There is a lot of content about development, and also about entrepreneurship, but I haven't seen as much about the combination of both.

## Final Words

So, that's what you can expect from this, kind of. Like always that I start something new, I am very excited about this and I am looking forward to see your opinions on my thoughts.
