As part of [joining my first book club ever](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2019/02/09/experimenting-with-a-slack-based-book-club) (I'm excited!) I've started reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.

I thought I hadn't read anything from the author, but turns out I had read a "comprehensive" summary of one of his previous books: [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://commoncog.com/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you).
