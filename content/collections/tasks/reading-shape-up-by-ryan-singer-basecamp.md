I've been a fan of the guys at [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) for a while, and read most of their books, so I'm thrilled get [this one](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) started.

It's also the first book I'll read in html! The only doubt I have is how I'll manage to take highlights as I usually do. We'll see.
