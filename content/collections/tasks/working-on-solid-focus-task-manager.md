Since I [configured my Solid data POD](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/configuring-a-self-hosted-solid-pod-server) I've been using [Solid Focus](https://noeldemartin.github.io/solid-focus) myself, and I've seen a couple of things that can be improved.

I've been thinking about Basecamp's concept of [appetite](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#setting-the-appetite) for planning. For me, it's important to think about the appetite twice. First, the total time I want to dedicate. But also, since I am working on this as a side-project, the ammount it takes in real-time for a task to be completed. I do roughly 10 hours/week of side-project work, so a 40 hours task that would normally be finished in a week takes me a month. Keeping that in mind, and given the low-impact of this task, I'm not willing to spend more than 8 hours for this. So in real time, it should be done within 2 weeks.
