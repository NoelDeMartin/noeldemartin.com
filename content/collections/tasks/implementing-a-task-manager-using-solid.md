Some months ago I started working on a protocol to build applications that decouple storage from service providers. You can read about that here: [https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data](https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data).

Well, one month ago Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) [announced](https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/one-small-step-for-the-web-87f92217d085) he's been working on a project called Solid, which is very similar to what I had in mind.

So I'll start working on a simple task manager using Solid to get my feet wet, and I'll decide whether to focus my efforts on Solid or continue developing my protocol.
