I joined [TBW](https://thebootstrappersworkshop.com/) 2 months ago, and it's been great so far. I decided to take part because I've been enjoying Seth Godin's content a lot, specially his blog and podcast. The format of the workshop also got my attention, with a focus on asynchronous communication and leveraging the cohort.

There is still ~1.5 months to go, so I'll be sure to get the best out of it.
