One month ago I [implemented a Task Manager using Solid](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-task-manager-using-solid). It was a proof of concept more than anything, but I got some feedback to improve it and there are some features missing that are essential to have this replace my current task manager. I continue to believe that Solid is really cool, so I'll improve it to the point that I can at least start using it myself.

In particular, these are some of the things I want to work on:

- Improve data management (maybe using [LDFlex](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/LDflex/) or [Soukai](https://noeldemartin.github.io/soukai/)).
- Improve UX.
- Improve documentation.
- Add new features such as editing, deleting, scheduling? etc.
