Last week I started to take part in the initial testing of [MoodleNet](https://moodle.com/moodlenet). I have already been using it, but since I was [attending FOSDEM](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/attending-fosdem) I couldn't dedicate much attention until now.

In case you're wondering, MoodleNet is "a new open social media platform for educators, focused on professional development and open content". And what am I doing there if I'm no educator? Well, I "am" an educator, since I teach to myself, as we all do. I've also imparted some classes about programming, but that's not really the point. My interest in MoodleNet resides on resource curation and social interactions around it. I've been using Evernote for a while to store my learning materials, but I'm sure there's a better way and MoodleNet could be it.

The project is also being developed in the open and using federation (ActivityPub), both of which I'm interested in.
