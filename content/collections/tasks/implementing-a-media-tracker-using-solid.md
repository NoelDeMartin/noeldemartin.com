I've recently [started using my Solid Task Manager in production](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/configuring-a-self-hosted-solid-pod-server). While I don't consider it finished, it's at a point where I can use it without adding more features. One of the things I want to do in [my Path](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/lessons-learned-musashi-by-eiji-yoshikawa#the-path-and-the-way) is to build the tools to have control in my digital life. I got tired of being at the mercy of others, so I don't want to use anything that doesn't embrace [Autonomous Data](https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data/). And the next step is to implement a Media Tracker.

At the moment, I am using [TViso](https://www.tviso.com) for tracking TV Shows and Movies, [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net) for Manga and nothing for Books. I am not happy with either of those services, but given the vendor lock-in I can't easily switch to alternatives. This makes a great opportunity to continue expanding my toolbox.

My [appetite](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#setting-the-appetite) for this task is of 40 hours with 5 weeks in real-time. Keeping this in mind, I'll scope this first version only to tracking Movies.
