After 10+ years making websites, you'd think I already know CSS. And I guess I do, but I don't really _know_ CSS. As [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) puts it: "if you don't learn how its underlying systems work, your mental model will always be incomplete.".

So I am taking his course, [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/).
