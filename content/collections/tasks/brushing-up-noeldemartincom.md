It's that time of the year, I'm back from holidays and it's a good time to do some maintenance tasks on my website. Such things include upgrading the Laravel version (I want to give Laravel Shift a try), install Laravel Nova, clean up some UI, clean up some texts and take a look at some performance improvements I have on my backlog.
