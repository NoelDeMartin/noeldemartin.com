A while ago I started working on a protocol that I called [Autonomous Data](https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data/), but I recently stopped working on it to [learn Solid](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-task-manager-using-solid).

After working with Solid, I confirmed the philosophy is actually the same as the protocol I was creating. It differs only on implementation details. Since the philosophy is to give the control of the data to the user, it should be possible to migrate data between them.

So I've decided to transform the Autonomous Data protocol to a philosophy instead (I know calling it "a philosophy" is confusing, I'll search a better word). In reality that's all it was, because I still hadn't documented any of the implementation details. And I'll rename the implementation I was working on to another protocol compatible with the Autonomous Data philosophy.
