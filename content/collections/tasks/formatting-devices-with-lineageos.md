My mobile phone, a [Google Nexus 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_6), is about to turn 7 years old. It hasn't received any updates for a long while, so I decided it's time to format it with [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/). I also have a [Nexus 7 tablet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_(2013)>) that will share the same fate.
