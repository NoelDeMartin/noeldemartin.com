This year, I'm attending my first in-person [Laracon](https://laracon.eu) ever! It's happening in Amsterdam on April 26th, and I'm super excited about it. Laravel is probably the project that's had the biggest impact on my development career, and I love its community. So I'm sure it will be tons of fun.

I'll be in Amsterdam from the 23rd to the 27th (which is [King's day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koningsdag)!).
