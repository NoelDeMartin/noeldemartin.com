Last year [I participated](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/testing-moodlenet) in MoodleNet's user testing, and now that [v1.0beta is approaching](https://blog.moodle.net/2020/approaching-v10-beta/) it's a good time to deploy my own instance. I have been running my [Mastodon instance-of-one](https://noeldemartin.social) for a couple of years, and that's the same approach I will follow for MoodleNet.

In contrast to last year I am employed by Moodle now. But I joined the [Moodle Apps team](https://moodle.com/app/), so I am doing this of my own volition as a side-project.
