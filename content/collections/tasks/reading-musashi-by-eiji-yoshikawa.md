I first heard about this book on Jocko Willink's podcast [episode 50](http://jockopodcast.com/2016/11/23/50-with-tim-ferriss-darkness-how-to-stay-on-the-path-last-days-of-life-what-to-do-back-up-plans-misconceptions/). Him and Tim Ferriss recommended it effusively. Considering that I enjoy their content and I love japanese culture, I decided to give it a shot.

Man, was it a good choice. The book is very long (1000+ pages), but I'm enjoying it a lot and I don't want it to end. It's divided in 7 parts and I'm currently reading the 6th.

I didn't realize it at first, but turns out one of my favourite manga, [Vagabond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagabond_%28manga%29), is based on the book. I love Takehiko Inoue's artwork, so it's awesome to recall his drawings while reading the book.
