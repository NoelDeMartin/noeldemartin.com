<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>If you are reading this, it means you've been selected to take part on the important task of reviewing the blog of Noel De Martin. Or you are reading this email from someone who has... Anyways, you have been selected.</p>

<p>Now, what does this mean? Which are your responsabilities when you become a reviewer of my blog? Actually, you don't really have any responsability, but you have some powers. Cool, right? powers without responsability :). The following are your powers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Being able to see posts before they are published. This can be a month before or merely 5 minutes before... It will depend on the post itself, and how urgent it's for me to publish it after I've written it.</li>
	<li>Being able to see sections of the website before being public. Same deal as with posts, but this is more likely to be closed to the public for some time (maybe I even push half-finished features).</li>
	<li>Have access to secret posts. Some times I may create some posts (more like quick notes) looking for feedback on some feature I am implementing or some experiment. Maybe I never end up making this posts public, so only reviewers will see those.</li>
</ul>

<p>And for now that's it, this is just one of my experiments so let's see how it evolves. What I expect from you (but remember, you don't have to, it's not a responsability) is that you give me feedback after reading the posts, if you do. This review can be any feedback from opinion to typos or errors you find. But please, put an emphasis on objective topics, for opinions I'd rather everybody uses the comments section, which will be public for everyone. Great feedback would be user experience commentaries like "you should have embedded that tweet instead of linking to it" or "the title of the post doesn't reflect what the post is actually about", things like that.</p>

<p>So if you're still interested, just follow the link below and fill the formulary, you'll become a full fledged reviewer with super powers :).</p>
