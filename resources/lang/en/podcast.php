        Wait, do I have a podcast now!?

        Actually, no ðŸ˜…. I just generated and episode once using [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/),
        and I decided to go through all the trouble of setting up [a feed](/podcast/feed.xml) to see how hard could
        it be. Turns out, it wasn't too hard!
